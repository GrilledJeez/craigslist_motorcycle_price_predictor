       " '\\n\\nQR Code Link to This Post\\n\\n\\nAn excellent example of the best color combination of this bike. Nearly showroom perfect - never wrecked or repaired. Recently serviced and in excellent condition. Super-smooth 4-cylinder 600cc motorcycle. Light, nimble and very powerful. This version of the 600cc Yamaha line has better throttle mapping that makes power delivery much more linear, without any unexpected peaks or dead spots in the power curve. Very easy to drive and great looking - I get compliments everywhere I go. The higher handlebars mean no laying on the fuel tank and a more upright and comfortable ride. Very low to the ground. I have a 30\" inseam and can put both feet almost flat on the ground. \\n\\n   All original with two exceptions. Firstly, and most obviously, is the phone holder on the handlebar - very sturdy and easy to use. Secondly, and less obvious, is a gear change. The front drive sprocket was enlarged by 1 tooth to allow for more spacing between the gears, meaning less shifting as you could hold each gear longer. This effectively improves fuel mileage and top speed (though I haven\\'t tested that).\\n\\n   Great fuel mileage, fantastic performance and an all-around looker. Can you ask for a better combination? Mileage may go up as I might ride it a little more but I am selling to get a bigger bike.

Over 96% approval rating with cash down.\\n2017 Suzuki GSX-R750Three decades ago Suzuki revolutionized sport bikes with the introduction of the GSX-R750. Ever since then, the GSX-R750 has remained true to its original concept and championship-winning heritage. On the road or on the track, the GSX-R750 delivers a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, crisp handling, compact size and light weight. Its secret is an unequaled pairing of 750cc performance with the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600cc Supersport, complemented by technologically advanced suspension front and rear. Try a GSX-R750 and you’ll quickly realize this motorcycle defines performance riding from the center of the sportbike class.Built to own the racetrack and let loose on the streets. Since 1985, the GSX-R has been continuously refined to deliver new levels of performance and agility. This legacy of innovation continues with over 1 million legends madeFeatures may include:ENGINE\\tCompact 750cc 4-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio that produces remarkably strong high RPM power delivery.The energy efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) fuel injection uses eight, fine-spray 8-hole injectors for improved fuel atomization, which contributes to more complete combustion.An Engine Control Module (ECM) provides state-of-the-art engine management and has enhanced settings to suit the intake and exhaust systems, resulting in better fuel economy and linear throttle response.Advanced, MotoGP-developed transistorized ignition control programming helps maintain more precise spark timing across the range of engine speed and temperature range.CHASSISLightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum-alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that’s ready for race-track adaptation.Race-developed, lightweight SHOWA Big Piston front Forks (BPF) deliver superb feedback and consistent performance. Spring preload, rebound and compression damping are all fully adjustable.Single SHOWA rear shock features externally adjustable rebound and compression damping, along with adjustable ride height.Electronically controlled steering damper provides lighter steering at slower speeds and more damping force at racetrack and highway speeds.SUSPENSIONStylized Suzuki “S” 3-D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denotes the quality, sophistication and performance legacy of the brand.Optional single seat cowl can replace the passenger seat for an even more aggressive look or for use on solo rides, or track days.A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for GSX-R owners are available including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.12-month limited warranty.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Suzuki\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: GSX-R750\\n\\n\\n\\nMileage: 2625 mi\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U01909\\n\\n\\n\\nVIN: JS1GR7MA6H2101909\\n\\n',\n",

Over 96% approval rating with cash down.\\n2017 Ducati Monster 821 Dust GreyUnmistakably Monster112 HP Testastretta 11° engine, razor sharp handling, state of the art safety equipment,Riding Modes and unmistakable Ducati sound. Sport performance, Italian design and unique personality: Monster 821, essentially Monster.*The power values indicated above are measured using a chassis dynamometer. Homologated power data, as quoted in the Bike Registration Document, are measured using an engine dynamometer according to the homologation regulation. The two power values may differ because of the different measurement equipments.ConceptForms and functionalities.The performance and fluidity of the new  Testastretta 11°, the versatility of the three Riding Modes, the comfort  of the adjustable seat and the passenger handles make the Monster 821 the ideal bike for every occasion. With Monster, the design is unmistakably that of an icon. The fun has no limits.DesignIt takes just a glance to see all of the elements that contribute to creating the legendary Monster: the muscular, sporty line, the rounded front headlight flanked by the forks, the high number plate, the compact yet imposing metal fuel tank. The unmistakable \"minimalist\" design that gives you the impression of being in front of an engine, a frame, a tank, a seat, and nothing more.Despite its larger size, which offers unprecedented performance and versatility, the Monster\\'s proportions immediately reveal the heart of a sports bike. The mass is visually concentrated at the front and the engine area looks compact, even with the new water cooling system, into which the radiator and the water supply pipes have been cleverly incorporated. The engine is combined with an impressive side-mounted staggered exhaust system that leaves no room for doubt about the bike\\'s performance.The new Monster 821 clearly spells sophistication, modernity and substance thanks to its avant-garde technology and top-quality materials. Ducati\\'s traditional trellis frame has evolved, using a typical sports bike solution, in which the engine is the supporting element. The imposing metal tank in pure \"Monster style\" helps to define a superior class of bike.Testastretta 11°The Monster 821 is powered by the Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine, with air injection system. A secondary air system similar to the one used on the 1199 Panigale has been introduced in order to optimise operation and reduce combustion cycle variability, without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of clean air is injected into the exhaust pipe, enabling total oxidation of the hot exhaust gases, efficiently cutting hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels. The Testastretta 11° engine fitted to the Monster 821 is an exclusive feature of these bikes and its structure has been engineered to be an integral element of the frame. In addition, the air filter and exhaust system have been designed to provide improved torque at low-medium engine speeds.The Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine generates power equal to 82.4 kW (112CV) @ 9,250 rpm and 89.4 Nm (9.1kgm) of torque at 7,750 rpm.Exhaust systemThe Testastretta 11° 821 engine is combined with a type 2-1-2 exhaust system, which leaves no room for doubt about the performance that the new Monster 821 is capable of unleashing.The engine control unit has a lambda probe for each individual cylinder, guaranteeing delivery of the right amount of fuel, while the stylish vertically stacked cannon silencers are equipped with catalytic converters that ensure compliance with Euro 4 standards. An electronically controlled mid-section adjustment valve optimises exhaust pressure according to engine speed.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Ducati\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: Monster 821 Dust Grey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U23446B\\n\\n',\n",

Where do you even start! For one thing, what you see is what you get. With a bike, nothing's hidden under a hood or behind doors. And that's especially true of a naked bike, a machine where you can see the engine and the frame and just about everything else.Bikes like these make sense they're light and elemental and pure. And they can also be a ton of fun. Especially a machine like the all-new 2018 Honda CB650FWhile you may not have seen this machine before, we've been refining it for several years over in Europe. Now it's your turn, and like a European supermodel, the CB650F is honed, toned and gorgeous.We started with the engine from our popular CBR650F. Offering an 11,000 rpm redline, we gave it shorter gear ratios to ensure some rigorous acceleration through the midrange. Revised intakes and a free-breathing exhaust mean more peak power too. In short, it's a blast to ride. And check out those 4-into-1 exhaust pipes a styling touch to one of the most iconic Hondas ever, the CB400F Supersport.Genuine middleweight four-cylinder motorcycles are an important Honda tradition, and bigger isn't always better. With the new CB650F you get more of what matters   performance, acceleration, style and handling ability   without adding weight or cost.Features may include:Power Up!The 649cc engine uses a compact internal architecture, stacked six-speed gearbox and starter/clutch layout with the cylinders canted forward 30. The DOHC 16-valve cylinder head employs direct cam actuation with a 11.4:1 compression ratio.Good BonesThe CB650F's steel diamond frame features twin 64mm x 30mm elliptical spars. They're stiffer around the headstock and more flexible in the middle of the spars to deliver balanced handling characteristics with high levels of feedback.New Showa Fork TechnologyA brand-new 41mm Showa Dual Bending Valve (SDBV) fork improves ride comfort and handling. It delivers proportional rebound damping with firmer compression damping as the travel increases.Information CentralThe dash offers twin digital screens. On the left are the rev-counter and speedometer; on the right are a fuel gauge, clock, odometer and the warning lights. Both sides are lit by a white backlight. Let Us Get You Approved!

Ever since then, the GSX-R750 has remained true to its original concept and championship-winning heritage. On the road or on the track, the GSX-R750 delivers a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, crisp handling, compact size and light weight. Its secret is an unequaled pairing of 750cc performance with the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600cc Supersport, complemented by technologically advanced suspension front and rear. Try a GSX-R750 and you’ll quickly realize this motorcycle defines performance riding from the center of the sportbike class.Built to own the racetrack and let loose on the streets. Since 1985, the GSX-R has been continuously refined to deliver new levels of performance and agility. This legacy of innovation continues with over 1 million legends madeFeatures may include:ENGINE\\tCompact 750cc 4-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio that produces remarkably strong high RPM power delivery.The energy efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) fuel injection uses eight, fine-spray 8-hole injectors for improved fuel atomization, which contributes to more complete combustion.An Engine Control Module (ECM) provides state-of-the-art engine management and has enhanced settings to suit the intake and exhaust systems, resulting in better fuel economy and linear throttle response.Advanced, MotoGP-developed transistorized ignition control programming helps maintain more precise spark timing across the range of engine speed and temperature range.CHASSISLightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum-alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that’s ready for race-track adaptation.Race-developed, lightweight SHOWA Big Piston front Forks (BPF) deliver superb feedback and consistent performance. Spring preload, rebound and compression damping are all fully adjustable.Single SHOWA rear shock features externally adjustable rebound and compression damping, along with adjustable ride height.Electronically controlled steering damper provides lighter steering at slower speeds and more damping force at racetrack and highway speeds.SUSPENSIONStylized Suzuki “S” 3-D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denotes the quality, sophistication and performance legacy of the brand.Optional single seat cowl can replace the passenger seat for an even more aggressive look or for use on solo rides, or track days.A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for GSX-R owners are available including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.12-month limited warranty.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Suzuki\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: GSX-R750\\n\\n\\n\\nMileage: 2625 mi\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U01909\\n\\n\\n\\nVIN: JS1GR7MA6H2101909\\n\\n',\n",

At the heart of the new Street 500 Dark Custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle, you've got an all-new 494cc, liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine. The liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine is built to thrive in the hot temperatures and stop and go traffic of the city grid. The new Street 500 Harley-Davidson custom motorcycle is an easy-to-ride motorcycle that's quick and nimble on city streets. The Street 500 from Harley-Davidson features and easy lock-to-lock sweep of the handlebars for quick turns and  moves. It has a low 24.5-inch seat height for an easy reach to the pavement  The suspension on the Street 500 Harley motorcycle is specially tuned for this motorcycle and built to handle rough urban infrastructure.  Like all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Street 500 motorcycle is pure, premium Harley-Davidson. The Revolution X engine and black two into one exhaust produce authentic Harley-Davidson sound. The teardrop tank and fenders are metal. And, of course, you've got premium Harley-Davidson paint and a chrome tank emblem. The Street 500 motorcycle is a Harley-Davidson Dark Custom motorcycle with a stripped down, blacked-out, street custom look. The new Revolution X engine is blacked-out.

And you can count on this: every cubic centimeter of the 494cc Revolution X engine is pure Harley-Davidson. 60 degree cylinder's. 4 valves per head. And plenty of low-end torque.

It's built to give you a soul-satisfying ride at the kind of RPMs you find yourself riding at on city streets.Six Speed TransmissionThe new Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle gives you six gears to work with when you're out tearing up the city streets.

Looks as good as the day it left the showroom floor. Garage-kept. Vivid black and in essentially stock condition. The only upgrade is that I JUST installed Vance & Hines slip-on mufflers which sound fantastic, and a chrome 5 rail HD luggage rack. Bike has the 103 ci engine with the 6 speed transmission, HD quick-detach windshield, ABS, and the saddlebags have stiffeners around the top, keeping them looking as good as new.

And the all-new Africa Twin is the bike that will let you live those dreams. With a name made famous from Paris to Dakar and beyond, it has renowned reliability, the latest technology, and unsurpassed capability, allowing you to wander as far as your imagination allows.Features may include:PERFORMANCEParallel Twin Engine LayoutThe Africa Twin's parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.Tapered Aluminum HandlebarAnother example of fitting premium equipment to the Africa Twin wherever we can, the aluminum handlebar is much lighter than a steel unit. The design tapers from a thinner diameter under your grips to a fatter section at the bar-top clamp, and is fine-tuned for optimal flex and rigidity.Tires and wheelsReal adventure bikes use spoked wheels because they better survive the dings and hits of off-road riding. The Africa Twin  uses a 21-inch front and an 18-inch rear for superior performance, especially when it comes to off-road riding.BrakesWith a pair of 310mm wave-rotor front disc brakes and a single 256mm wave disc in the rear, the Africa Twin offers up ample stopping power in all conditions.Four-piston CalipersUp front, the Africa Twin features twin four-piston brake calipers for powerful braking performance. The radial-mount design also helps make them stiffer, increasing brake feel and control.Unicam Engine DesignHonda's exclusive Unicam engine design helps us give the Africa Twin a compact cylinder head for optimal engine placement. But the engine also benefits from superior performance, thanks to the entire cylinder-head layout. It's the best of both worlds!Twin IntakesThe Africa Twin uses a unique twin air-intake design with twin vertical filtration elements. This gives you excellent engine performance with plenty of clean air, even under dusty conditions.COMFORTRally WindscreenDeveloped from our racing experience in the Dakar Rally, the Africa Twin's windscreen helps shield you from the wind and the elements, especially during long miles of high-speed touring. At lower speeds, the clear construction gives you better visibility off road.Narrow Riding PositionAdventure riding is an active sport, and that means you need to be able to move around on your bike naturally and athletically. The Africa Twin is extremely narrow where you sit, and the peg-bar-seat triangle lets you move up and forward and far back as well, to enhance handling, especially under demanding trail conditions.Adjustable SeatThe Africa Twin offers an adjustable two-position rider's seat. This makes reaching the ground easier, and also lets you fine-tune your riding environment in respect to the footpeg and handlebar placement.Biaxial CounterbalanceBy using counterbalancing elements on two axes, Honda's engineers can cancel out both primary and coupling vibrations from the engine. The result is that we can mount the engine solidly for superior strength and handling, yet you still get an extraordinarily smooth, vibration-free ride.HANDLING43-degree steering lockWith 43 degrees of steering lock both left and right, the Africa Twin provides excellent maneuverability on tight trails. This is one of the reasons the Africa Twin feels so much more nimble than many of the other bigger adventure bikes out there. Let Us Get You Approved!

And the all-new Africa Twin is the bike that will let you live those dreams. With a name made famous from Paris to Dakar and beyond, it has renowned reliability, the latest technology, and unsurpassed capability, allowing you to wander as far as your imagination allows.Features may include:PERFORMANCEParallel Twin Engine LayoutThe Africa Twin's parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.Tapered Aluminum HandlebarAnother example of fitting premium equipment to the Africa Twin wherever we can, the aluminum handlebar is much lighter than a steel unit. The design tapers from a thinner diameter under your grips to a fatter section at the bar-top clamp, and is fine-tuned for optimal flex and rigidity.Tires and wheelsReal adventure bikes use spoked wheels because they better survive the dings and hits of off-road riding. The Africa Twin  uses a 21-inch front and an 18-inch rear for superior performance, especially when it comes to off-road riding.BrakesWith a pair of 310mm wave-rotor front disc brakes and a single 256mm wave disc in the rear, the Africa Twin offers up ample stopping power in all conditions.Four-piston CalipersUp front, the Africa Twin features twin four-piston brake calipers for powerful braking performance.

The unmistakable \"minimalist\" design that gives you the impression of being in front of an engine, a frame, a tank, a seat, and nothing more.Despite its larger size, which offers unprecedented performance and versatility, the Monster\\'s proportions immediately reveal the heart of a sports bike. The mass is visually concentrated at the front and the engine area looks compact, even with the new water cooling system, into which the radiator and the water supply pipes have been cleverly incorporated. The engine is combined with an impressive side-mounted staggered exhaust system that leaves no room for doubt about the bike\\'s performance.The new Monster 821 clearly spells sophistication, modernity and substance thanks to its avant-garde technology and top-quality materials. Ducati\\'s traditional trellis frame has evolved, using a typical sports bike solution, in which the engine is the supporting element. The imposing metal tank in pure \"Monster style\" helps to define a superior class of bike.Testastretta 11°The Monster 821 is powered by the Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine, with air injection system. A secondary air system similar to the one used on the 1199 Panigale has been introduced in order to optimise operation and reduce combustion cycle variability, without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of clean air is injected into the exhaust pipe, enabling total oxidation of the hot exhaust gases, efficiently cutting hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels. The Testastretta 11° engine fitted to the Monster 821 is an exclusive feature of these bikes and its structure has been engineered to be an integral element of the frame. In addition, the air filter and exhaust system have been designed to provide improved torque at low-medium engine speeds.The Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine generates power equal to 82.4 kW (112CV) @ 9,250 rpm and 89.4 Nm (9.1kgm) of torque at 7,750 rpm.Exhaust systemThe Testastretta 11° 821 engine is combined with a type 2-1-2 exhaust system, which leaves no room for doubt about the performance that the new Monster 821 is capable of unleashing.The engine control unit has a lambda probe for each individual cylinder, guaranteeing delivery of the right amount of fuel, while the stylish vertically stacked cannon silencers are equipped with catalytic converters that ensure compliance with Euro 4 standards. An electronically controlled mid-section adjustment valve optimises exhaust pressure according to engine speed.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Ducati\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: Monster 821 Dust Grey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U23446B\\n\\n',\n",

At the very top of the mountain in terms of power, features and riding experience, this is the motorcycle you'll find.The 2014 Harley-Davidson CVO Limited model is a high-end performance motorcycle with Twin Cam 110 power that gives you the ultimate in premium featured touring. As part of Project RushMore for 2014, the CVO Limited has been redesigned from the ground up for more comfort, more power, better braking and handling and more classic style. The iconic batwing H-D fairing has been totally redesigned to reduce head buffeting. This bike is powered by a new Harley High Output Twin Cam 110 Engine with Screamin' Eagle badges. The new high-output Twin Cam 110 engine with Screamin' Eagle badges provides 110 cubic inches of power, a low cruising rpm, more low end torque, more passing power, along with silky smooth shifting of its 6-speed cruise drive transmission. The H-D CVO Limited motorcycle features the new Reflex anti-lock braking system (ABS) with dynamically, electronically linked brakes for optimum braking in all conditions. This big V-Twin Cam 110 performance motorcycle is custom touring at its finest. We've added more room for the passenger. For an ultra comfortable ride the seat is heated. Take a good look at all of the premium features and components of this bike, including the Harley-Davidson Twin Cam 110 engine with Screamin' Eagle badges and upgraded Boom! Box 6.5 infotainment system with it's 6.5  full color screen.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - EngineAs every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we've been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson engine.New Boom! Box 6.5GT RadioLet's start with the big news: 25% more volume for your tunes. The new Boom! Box 6.5GT Radio puts out 75 watts per channel at 1% distortion and features a factory-tuned, optimized equalizer that pumps out more power and can be played louder while maintaining the clarity of your sound. And the new speed tuning system delivers more than just volume changes at different speeds. It changes the level of bass and treble to dial-in the best sound, whether you're running at stately pace down the strip or going hell for leather down an open stretch of road.Project RUSHMORE - ConfidenceHere are some of the innovations The Rider Project led to: the new Reflex Linked Brakes with Anti-lock Braking System. New dual halogen and LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a new steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there's wet pavement. We've made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better.Project RUSHMORE - ComfortWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders and passengers putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Let Us Get You Approved!

Motorcycling has never been about blending in or being one of the herd. And that's especially true in the world of cruisers and customs. But we think a bike has to work as good as it looks, and that's what really sets the Honda Fury apart. Wanna turn some heads? The Fury is guaranteed to do that. But it's also for riders who want a machine that they can cruise on all day long, that doesn't spend its life in the service bay. Long, lean and mean, stretching nearly six feet from axle to axle, this is an outrageous testimony to the builder's art. And the power and sound coming from its big 1312cc V-twin? Pure music. With clean, crisp lines few customs ever achieve, the Fury is as eye-catching when it's stopped as when it's rolling down the highway. One ride, and you'll be hooked.Features may include:InnovationsBrakesA single powerful 336mm-diameter front-disc brake is complemented by a 296mm brake disc in back. An ABS version is also available.Long RakeA raked-out front end and condensed, hard-tail look to the rear, plus a stretched wheelbase. And that long wheelbase is no illusion the Fury stretches a full 71.2 inches between axles.High-Tensile Steel FrameThe Fury's high-tensile steel frame is the centerpiece to this machine's open, minimalist chopper styling. It's functional too, delivering smooth ride quality and responsive handling.Chopper StylingThe Fury is one of the most authentic, radically styled custom motorcycles that Honda has ever produced. It features a teardrop seamless fuel tank, an ingenious single-shock rear suspension system and an aluminum swingarm.Fuel InjectionForget about fiddling with a choke the Fury's fuel-injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes.1300cc V-Twin EngineA powerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.Low SeatThe Fury's super-low 26.7-inch seat height is an integral design element that fits in behind the slim and long fuel tank.Shaft Final DriveThe shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.ExhaustThe Fury's engine features specially designed camshafts that also add to the unique V-twin sound and power-pulse exhaust sensations.Unique Wheels and TiresA fat 200-series rear tire is paired with a slim 21-inch front tire, both wrapped around distinctive alloy wheels.

Huge changes are going to jump out at you. First is the CRF450R's all-new air-fork front suspension. Nearly two pounds lighter than a coil-spring fork, it offers easier adjustment, less internal friction, and even better handling. Next, an all-new twin-spar aluminum frame. You'll see some big changes in the steering-head area. That's because the frame is designed specifically to work with the new fork.Check out the CRF450R's short radical new twin exhaust. The system moves the mufflers in way closer to the bike's center of mass. They're super short and compact, and work in perfect concert with the 2013 model's new bodywork to make this the most flickable CRF450R ever!In fact, everywhere you look you're going to see upgrades this year: The engine gets a new piston shape, porting, and valve timing, along with more compression for more power. The radiators are smaller and flow more air. The clutch is totally redesigned with six springs for better feel at the lever. Even the footpegs and tires get the Honda touch.Without a doubt, the 2013 CRF 450R is the most dialed-in bike and still the lightest weight in its class. Do your part, and you're going to be a permanent fixture on the podium with this one. Let Us Get You Approved!

It is fast and attracts a lot of attention. Tires have about 1500 miles on them. Bike was never tracked or abused. This survivor could be the nicest example around. I am selling to ease into a more sedate ride. I have extras which include new OEM ECU, Heli Bars, and new OEM windscreen. Clear title. No rides without cash on the table. I don't need help selling the bike and prefer cash as payment.    \",\n",

So when we built the new Softail Slim S, we loaded it up with the most powerful engine you can get in a cruiser this year.American MuscleWe've taken everything that was great about the Softail Slim and added a little more. For starters, we've added power with a Screamin' Eagle Air-Cooled Twin Cam 110B engine. We've taken the military theme even further with an awesome Olive Gold Denim paint option and made the rest black to the core. Black triple clamp and riser, gloss black headlamp ring, fork slider covers and lower forks. Black brake levers, mirrors and black over/under shotgun exhaust with slash cut muffler. Every inch is modern power with old iron attitude.Features may include:Authentic StylingGet an eyeful of a Softail motorcycle and you see more than some weepy-eyed exercise in nostalgia. You're looking at the kind of style that has the power to defy time. Honest. Uncluttered. Unaffected by the fad of the moment. There's a good reason for this.Iconic EngineThe air-cooled 45 V-Twin engine at the heart of every Softail model is a prime example of what makes a Harley-Davidson motorcycle more satisfying than anything else. Its clean, uncluttered shape fits perfectly in the downtubes of the frame. Twist the throttle and the surge of torque hits you exactly where it counts.TechnologyThe beauty of the technology on a Softail motorcycle is that it never looks technological. That didn't happen by accident and it doesn't come easy, particularly when you consider that the inspiration for the family is the clean, wide-open lines of a vintage hardtail.HandlingIf you've never experienced a Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle, it's time to find out what you've been missing. The venerable Softail frame has logged untold millions of miles, and we've put every one of them to good use.ComfortThe authentic look of a Softail motorcycle comes from the days before anyone knew much about building a suspension. The rigid hardtail frames of yesteryear had a pure, uncluttered look that riders still love. Let Us Get You Approved!

The GSX-S750 features fresh, aggressive styling that encompasses the appearance of quality.As with the GSX-S1000, this new GSX-S750 inherits its heart and soul from Suzuki's MotoGP race experience and the 30-year heritage of the GSX-R750. With boosted engine power and a suite of rider-assist features, this restyled GSX-S750 is ready to capture hearts and turn heads as the new leader in its class.This is the perfect sportbike response to the craving of today's discriminating riders, this new GSX-S750 looks better and outperforms its popular predecessor   and other entries in the class. It is nimble, comfortable, and an exhilarating, fun ride.Features may include:New fuel-injected, 749cc, 4-cylinder engine uses GSX-R architecture to deliver a torque-rich sportbike experience.Suzuki Advanced Traction Control* lets the rider select sensitivity to match road conditions.The unique chassis integrates the best qualities of a tubular streetbike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame, and is fitted with KYB suspension to provide precise handling.ENGINEPotent 749cc 4-cylinder fuel-injected engine uses 2005 GSX-R750 architecture so the power delivery is an excellent bled of strong low-end and a muscular top end.Using the K5 generation GSX-R engine architecture also permits a shorter chassis which greatly enhances handling. This also makes the GSX-S750 the only motorcycle in its class with an engine with SuperSport lineage.Ventilation holes are added to the bottom side of each cylinder in the GSX-S750's crankcase. The holes reduce pumping loss to help produce power and gain fuel economy.TRANSMISSIONThe race-proven six-speed close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine length.The shorter final gear ratio enables the new GSX-S750 accelerate quicker than the prior model while the additional engine power maintains the same top speed potential.Large diameter, wet multi-plate clutch is derived from a GSX-R750 design to easily transmit power while the rack and pinion clutch release provides the rider with superb friction-point feel.CHASSISWith styling influenced by the GSX-S1000, but with its own aggressive turn, the GSX-S750's new bodywork looks wild and forceful, yet keeps the rider comfortable at all times.The new headlight nacelle houses provides a visual focal point while the under cowl connects the chassis styling to the engine and new exhaust system.Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular-style street bike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A reasonable sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests and seat. Let Us Get You Approved!

The Harley Street Glide FLHX model has a 2-1-2 exhaust. Check out all of the H-D Street Glide FLHX model's specs and features and see why this bike is meant for motorcycle touring. Take a look at more of the Harley-Davidson touring motorcycles including the motorcycle luggage storage capacity of the Electra Glide Classic model or the Road Glide Ultra model ideal for motorcycle travel.Classic Fuel TankPart of the unmistakable style of the Harley-Davidson Street Glide motorcycle is plenty of room for showing off your paint. This classically styled, bold six-gallon fuel tank doesn't just give you a bigger canvas for premium or custom paint; it holds six gallons of go so you can eat up a lot more road between pit stops. We know fuel economy is important but so is style. Sharp, eye-catching colors and precision-crafted Harley-Davidson tank medallions complete the unique look of this tough bagger.Twin Cam 103 Engine HeritageThe knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103 engine. We painstakingly perfected every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson's unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution, Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 96 engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two wheels.Harman/Kardon Advanced Audio SystemNaturally, the king of the road gets some royal extras. The premium two-speaker, 20-watt per channel Harman/Kardon audio system boasts great sound for booming down the boulevard and highway, and, yeah, it might as well go to 11. It's loud, proud and comes with AM/FM receiver and accommodates a CD or MP3 player. Riding free just wouldn't be the same without the right soundtrack.Dunlop Multi-Tread TiresThe 180mm back tire is engineered to do more than fill out the rear fender and put a bigger patch of rubber on the road. Dunlop Multi-Tread technology uses harder compounds at the center and softer on the sides for a tire that still knows how to knuckle-down on corners. Perfect for making this bike agile on every curvy stretch of road. And the way it feels going through an abrupt off-camber turn will put a grin on your face that'll last to the next state line.Two-Up SeatingModern styling and comfort that doesn't sacrifice an ounce of nostalgic style: This ultimate Touring saddle features a sculpted seat with a deeper contoured bucket and narrower neck, to relieve pressure on your thighs, while providing more back support and comfort for a wide variety of rider sizes. And the lower seat height 26.1 inches to be exact puts your feet closer to the road to enhance your confidence. Additionally, the leather trim and premium stitching accentuate the advanced ergonomics while giving the seat that sharp detail you only find on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It's science in service of comfort, and your way to beat fatigue over the long haul. Let Us Get You Approved!

Twist the throttle and it responds with awesome acceleration and crisp throttle response in every gear with an unbelievable top-end charge. Thanks to a lightweight and rigid twin-spar aluminum frame and state-of-the-art suspension, that performance is matched by equally impressive handling, providing exceptional control in tight corners, reassuring stability in sweeping turns and a smooth ride on the highway.Features may include:Powerful 1340cc in-line 4-cylinder fuel-injected, liquid-cooled DOHC engine built to deliver a broad wave of torque for effortless acceleration.Suzuki Drive Mode Selector (S-DMS) lets riders select engine power output to match preferences or riding conditions.Dual 310mm (12.2 inch) floating-brake rotors are mated with radial-mount Brembo monobloc front brake calipers. The calipers are lighter and more rigid than conventional bolt-together calipers, deliver better feedback, and are ?tted with larger pistons that increase initial bite for greater controllability. The hollow-type mounting bolts further reduce weight.The standard equipment Antilock Brake System (ABS)* unit features a lightweight, compact design. The ABS enhances brake performance by helping prevent, to a certain extent, wheel locking due to changes in road conditions or excessive braking, by matching stopping power to available traction.

At the heart of the new Street 500 Dark Custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle, you've got an all-new 494cc, liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine. The liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine is built to thrive in the hot temperatures and stop and go traffic of the city grid. The new Street 500 Harley-Davidson custom motorcycle is an easy-to-ride motorcycle that's quick and nimble on city streets. The Street 500 from Harley-Davidson features and easy lock-to-lock sweep of the handlebars for quick turns and  moves. It has a low 24.5-inch seat height for an easy reach to the pavement  The suspension on the Street 500 Harley motorcycle is specially tuned for this motorcycle and built to handle rough urban infrastructure.  Like all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Street 500 motorcycle is pure, premium Harley-Davidson. The Revolution X engine and black two into one exhaust produce authentic Harley-Davidson sound. The teardrop tank and fenders are metal. And, of course, you've got premium Harley-Davidson paint and a chrome tank emblem. The Street 500 motorcycle is a Harley-Davidson Dark Custom motorcycle with a stripped down, blacked-out, street custom look. The new Revolution X engine is blacked-out. There's a black cafe style speed screen, black two into one exhaust, black fork gaiters  and black cast aluminum wheels.Features May Include:All-New Liquid-Cooled Revolution X EngineThe all-new liquid-cooled Revolution X engine that powers the Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle is 494 cubic centimeters of genuine Harley-Davidson V-Twin built to thrive in high temperatures and heavy traffic.

And you can count on this: every cubic centimeter of the 494cc Revolution X engine is pure Harley-Davidson. 60 degree cylinder's. 4 valves per head. And plenty of low-end torque. You don't have to be winding the RPMs up to five figures to feel the strength and character of this engine. It's built to give you a soul-satisfying ride at the kind of RPMs you find yourself riding at on city streets.Six Speed TransmissionThe new Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle gives you six gears to work with when you're out tearing up the city streets. A smooth-shifting 6 speed transmission makes it easy to stay in the powerband when traffic is stop-and-go. And when the road opens up, sixth gear let's you drop the engine into a nice, easy groove for a long, comfortable ride at highway speeds.True Harley-Davidson SoundSome motorcycles make noise. The Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle makes sound. The deep, thumping Harley-Davidson rumble that doesn't demand attention, but gets it anyway. We take the sound of every motorcycle we make very seriously. And tune it to perfection in our state-of-the-art sound facility in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin USA. When you hear the sound pouring out of the upswept muffler on the Street 500 model, you'll have no doubt we took the time to get it right. This is the note that instantly says Harley-Davidson.

It's an utterly stunning head-turner, and one look will tell you why: Blacked-out 745 cc V-twin engine and black rims sporting matte silver highlights, bobbed fenders, spoke wheels, and beefy front fork. Then the exhaust note hits you, a deep, throaty pulse rumbling from dual exhausts. It's hard to resist, we know. And downright impossible once you've seen its price tag. And best of all, the Shadow Phantom gets an estimated 56 miles per gallon! Sometimes a whisper is way louder than a shout. And that's most definitely the case with the Shadow Phantom.

Make the ride a cosmic leap beyond anything the rider has experienced in terms of function and comfort. So here we are countless miles later. And everything we’ve learned has been built into these Project RUSHMORE machines. One-touch saddlebags, GPS and infotainment, better airflow around the rider, more passing power, the list goes on. And we did it all with out letting the soul of the machine get lost in gadgetry. To see how far it’s all come, check out this machine that bears the Electra Glide name for 2016.\\n\\nFeatures may include:\\nControl\\nProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.\\n\\nInfotainment\\nWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.\\n\\nStyle\\nWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.\\n\\nStop by or call the House of Harley-Davidson today! \\n*Price does not include CPO, Doc & License Fees; Subject to prior sale\\n',\n",

Premium quality materials and refined finishing blend with top-level technology in the S version to bring the most unique and unmatched design to life. Guarded at the heart of the motorcycle, the new Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 engine is the undeniable centrepiece. Shiny and black with machined details in full view, ready to deliver terrific torque throughout the rev range.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\nLocation: Denali HD – Wasilla\\nCondition: Pre-owned\\nStock Number: 002154\\nYear: 2016\\nMake: Ducati\\nModel: XDiavel S\\nVehicle Type: Motorcycle\\nCategory: Cruiser\\nMileage: 3,237 miles\\nEngine: Liquid-Cooled Testastretta DVT 1262\\nColor: Thrilling Black\\n\\n\\nExtras on this bike:\\n\\nTermignoni Exhaust System\\nLow Miles!\\n\\n\\nThis is X\\nXDiavel represents the merger of two worlds: that of the cruiser for long, low speed relaxing journeys, and that of the Ducati, characterised by Italian style, technical sophistication and very high performance. The X of XDiavel is just that: the crossover between apparently differing and distant worlds, united in a single bike, a synthesis where both are fully realised without any compromises.\\n\\nLow speed excitement\\nDucati is joining the cruiser world, doing so in its own particular way, by presenting a real cruiser but with the design, technological content and performance typical of the bikes of Borgo Panigale. XDiavel is \"low speed excitement\", where a relaxed low speed is typical of the cruiser world, while the excitement and adrenaline of sports riding are the very values of Ducati.\\n\\nDesign\\nLong, low, muscular, with modern shapes and technologically advanced systems. But above all sexy. A bike designed with the cruiser world in mind but also with Ducati DNA, steering the cruiser concept into modern times, and the future, a real \"Technocruiser\".\\n\\nTestastretta DVT 1262\\nThe twin-cylinder Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 is a completely new and Euro 4 approved engine which uses the Desmodromic Variable Timing system. The increase in engine capacity compared to the Testastretta 1200, together with the use of the Desmodromic Variable Timing system, has enabled supply of incredibly full and at the same time fluid torque at low running speeds, while also guaranteeing sports performance when the throttle is fully opened. In addition, the Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 has a particularly detailed design which, thanks to the repositioning of the water pump inside the V of the cylinders, does away with the cooling system pipes on the left side.\\n\\nBelt transmission\\nThe XDiavel is the first Ducati to use belt final drive. A must in the cruiser world, the system was developed for the XDiavel by Ducati engineers so as to be able to guarantee reliable and safe transmission of the power supplied by the Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262. The advantages of the belt are the low noise level, cleaning, reduced maintenance and fluid response to opening the gas, as befits a real cruiser.\\n\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

This engine provides a unique power character, with outstanding low- to mid-range torque and very linear throttle response, combined with strong high-rpm pulling power. This motor develops 50 foot pounds of torque and is designed to maximize riding excitement in the real world.\\n\\nCrossplane Concept\\nThe 2-cylinder engine features Yamaha’s “Crossplane Concept” 270-degree crank that provides linear torque development in response to the rider’s throttle input. The CP2® engine is also light, slim and compact and offers an excellent level of rider/machine communication.\\n\\nOffset Cylinder Block\\nThe CP2 engine shifts its cylinder bores slightly forward of the crankshaft axis, towards the exhaust side. This offset reduces piston to cylinder wall friction, for more power and improved fuel economy.\\n\\nChassis/Suspension:\\nRefined Front Fork\\nThe front suspension features a 41mm fork with 5.1 inches of travel, with new spring rates and damping settings for a more refined suspension feel and improved performance across a wide range of riding styles.\\n\\nUpgraded Monocross® Shock\\nThe MT-07 features an all-new, link-type Monocross shock, now adjustable for both rebound damping and spring preload, for improved tuneability, with settings developed to match the upgraded front fork. The shock provides 5.1 inches of rear travel, and is positioned below the seat with an almost horizontal alignment, which helps make the chassis much more compact.\\n\\nCompact Frame Design\\nA lightweight, high-strength steel frame provides an optimized rigidity balance for nimble, agile handling. The engine is a stressed member of the chassis, allowing a lighter, more compact main frame design and a total wet weight of only 403 lb.\\n\\nAdditional\\nSleek New Bodywork\\nThe MT-07 features a refined new style to match the rest of the MT family, including an angular new headlight, more aggressive intake scoops, a sleeker fuel tank cover, and a new layered tail design featuring a more compact LED tail light.\\n\\nErgonomically Designed Fuel Tank\\nThe slim 3.7 gallon fuel tank is both stylish and compact to provide excellent comfort and knee grip area, while still permitting easier planting of both feet on the ground, for added rider confidence at stops.\\n\\nAdvanced Instrumentation\\nThe compact full-LCD instrument panel includes a digital bar-type tachometer display with gear position indicator, digital speedometer, odometer, dual trip meters, fuel gauge, fuel reserve trip meter, clock, instant and average fuel consumption and a range of warning and indicator lights.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.\\n\\nInfotainment\\nWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.\\n\\nStyle\\nWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.\\n\\nSTREET INSPIRED PAINT\\nWe created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.\\n\\nLOW SEAT & SLAMMED SUSPENSION\\nThe combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you\\'re dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.\\n\\nTUCK AND ROLL SEAT\\nA solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.\\n\\nMACHINED 9-SPOKE WHEELS\\nNine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.\\n\\n883CC AIR-COOLED EVOLUTION® ENGINE\\nAuthentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.\\n\\nDRAG-STYLE HANDLEBAR\\nBorn at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

The Softail® Deluxe comes with optional Hard Candy Custom™ paint, a large metal flake paint finish that recalls the iconic styling of \\'70s custom bikes, and offers blazing color showing through a deep, finish. The Harley® fenders on the Softail® Deluxe model are true retro style with their long lines and chrome Harley® fender tips. And each fender says Deluxe so everyone will know how you roll. The Harley® Softail® Deluxe model has a wide front end fork and gorgeous 7 inch ball motorcycle headlamp. Whitewall tires give this motorcycle cruiser a 1950s boulevard retro motorcycle look. The H-D® Softail® Deluxe model features a powerful air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley® engine with 6 speed cruise drive transmission, providing more performance power for passing, hill-climbing, and riding with passenger and luggage. Hit the road in style with this classic two up FLSTN Softail® Deluxe model\\'s seat. At a lowdown 24.5 inches, it\\'s among the lowest seat heights you\\'ll find. And we\\'ve added some ergonomics to make riding solo or duo even easier, especially for riders with a shorter inseam. \\'Collapsing\\' sides create a narrow seat profile, and the passenger seat pillion is detachable.\\n\\nFeatures may include:\\nHidden Rear Shocks\\nIf you want a comfortable bike but love that rigid-suspension look, you\\'ve come to the right bike. We\\'ve kept all the modern comforts where they belong--below the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage \"hardtail\" frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It\\'s a signature rigid look, and you\\'ll only find it on a Softail® model.\\n\\nTank-Mounted Console\\nA big, bold speedometer and odometer display, along with an ancillary display for gear and rpm, offer up the information you need on the fly.\\n\\nTwin Cam 103™ Engine Innovation\\nFire up the Twin Cam 103™ engine and feel the low-end torque unleashed. Thanks to the lightweight piston design, delivery of the added power is more refined than ever. Then put your foot on the shifter and feel how the engine and Six-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission were designed to work together. Six speeds. A strong driveline and strong internal parts. Low routine maintenance. And a low cruising rpm couldn\\'t feel better.\\n\\nStandard Anti-Lock Brakes\\nWhen it comes to the Softail® Deluxe model with ABS, \"stopping power\" has a double meaning. The components of our ABS are tastefully hidden within the wheel hub, so you\\'ll still turn heads with clean, streamlined design. More importantly, though, you get certainty in the saddle knowing your bike\\'s going to behave when you need it.\\n\\nDunlop® Tires\\nWhether you\\'re crossing state lines or staying within city limits, you want a confident feeling of sure contact with the road. The front end holds a premium touring tire with a three-ply polyester casing and two fiberglass belts. The back cruiser tire has an advanced tread pattern. Made from a specifically formulated compound, it delivers outstanding grip in wet or dry weather. And since they\\'re from Dunlop®, you know you\\'re wrapping your premium rollers in quality rubber.\\n\\nFull-Length Rider Footboards\\nYour boots were made for riding, in any way you see fit. Our full-length footboards boast a tried and true design that\\'s stood the test of time. Plenty of foot positions for your taste and comfort. Rubber vibration isolation for a comfortable ride. And heel-toe shifting for confident shifting every time. It takes a few rides, but once you\\'ve gotten used to the smooth heel-toe rhythm, you\\'ll never give it up.    ',\n",
