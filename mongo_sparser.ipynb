       " '\\n\\nQR Code Link to This Post\\n\\n\\nAn excellent example of the best color combination of this bike. Nearly showroom perfect - never wrecked or repaired. Recently serviced and in excellent condition. Super-smooth 4-cylinder 600cc motorcycle. Light, nimble and very powerful. This version of the 600cc Yamaha line has better throttle mapping that makes power delivery much more linear, without any unexpected peaks or dead spots in the power curve. Very easy to drive and great looking - I get compliments everywhere I go. The higher handlebars mean no laying on the fuel tank and a more upright and comfortable ride. Very low to the ground. I have a 30\" inseam and can put both feet almost flat on the ground. \\n\\n   All original with two exceptions. Firstly, and most obviously, is the phone holder on the handlebar - very sturdy and easy to use. Secondly, and less obvious, is a gear change. The front drive sprocket was enlarged by 1 tooth to allow for more spacing between the gears, meaning less shifting as you could hold each gear longer. This effectively improves fuel mileage and top speed (though I haven\\'t tested that).\\n\\n   Great fuel mileage, fantastic performance and an all-around looker. Can you ask for a better combination? Mileage may go up as I might ride it a little more but I am selling to get a bigger bike.

Over 96% approval rating with cash down.\\n2017 Suzuki GSX-R750Three decades ago Suzuki revolutionized sport bikes with the introduction of the GSX-R750. Ever since then, the GSX-R750 has remained true to its original concept and championship-winning heritage. On the road or on the track, the GSX-R750 delivers a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, crisp handling, compact size and light weight. Its secret is an unequaled pairing of 750cc performance with the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600cc Supersport, complemented by technologically advanced suspension front and rear. Try a GSX-R750 and you’ll quickly realize this motorcycle defines performance riding from the center of the sportbike class.Built to own the racetrack and let loose on the streets. Since 1985, the GSX-R has been continuously refined to deliver new levels of performance and agility. This legacy of innovation continues with over 1 million legends madeFeatures may include:ENGINE\\tCompact 750cc 4-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio that produces remarkably strong high RPM power delivery.The energy efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) fuel injection uses eight, fine-spray 8-hole injectors for improved fuel atomization, which contributes to more complete combustion.An Engine Control Module (ECM) provides state-of-the-art engine management and has enhanced settings to suit the intake and exhaust systems, resulting in better fuel economy and linear throttle response.Advanced, MotoGP-developed transistorized ignition control programming helps maintain more precise spark timing across the range of engine speed and temperature range.CHASSISLightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum-alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that’s ready for race-track adaptation.Race-developed, lightweight SHOWA Big Piston front Forks (BPF) deliver superb feedback and consistent performance. Spring preload, rebound and compression damping are all fully adjustable.Single SHOWA rear shock features externally adjustable rebound and compression damping, along with adjustable ride height.Electronically controlled steering damper provides lighter steering at slower speeds and more damping force at racetrack and highway speeds.SUSPENSIONStylized Suzuki “S” 3-D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denotes the quality, sophistication and performance legacy of the brand.Optional single seat cowl can replace the passenger seat for an even more aggressive look or for use on solo rides, or track days.A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for GSX-R owners are available including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.12-month limited warranty.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Suzuki\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: GSX-R750\\n\\n\\n\\nMileage: 2625 mi\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U01909\\n\\n\\n\\nVIN: JS1GR7MA6H2101909\\n\\n',\n",

Sport performance, Italian design and unique personality: Monster 821, essentially Monster.*The power values indicated above are measured using a chassis dynamometer. Homologated power data, as quoted in the Bike Registration Document, are measured using an engine dynamometer according to the homologation regulation. The two power values may differ because of the different measurement equipments.ConceptForms and functionalities.The performance and fluidity of the new  Testastretta 11°, the versatility of the three Riding Modes, the comfort  of the adjustable seat and the passenger handles make the Monster 821 the ideal bike for every occasion. With Monster, the design is unmistakably that of an icon. The fun has no limits.DesignIt takes just a glance to see all of the elements that contribute to creating the legendary Monster: the muscular, sporty line, the rounded front headlight flanked by the forks, the high number plate, the compact yet imposing metal fuel tank. The unmistakable \"minimalist\" design that gives you the impression of being in front of an engine, a frame, a tank, a seat, and nothing more.Despite its larger size, which offers unprecedented performance and versatility, the Monster\\'s proportions immediately reveal the heart of a sports bike. The mass is visually concentrated at the front and the engine area looks compact, even with the new water cooling system, into which the radiator and the water supply pipes have been cleverly incorporated. The engine is combined with an impressive side-mounted staggered exhaust system that leaves no room for doubt about the bike\\'s performance.The new Monster 821 clearly spells sophistication, modernity and substance thanks to its avant-garde technology and top-quality materials. Ducati\\'s traditional trellis frame has evolved, using a typical sports bike solution, in which the engine is the supporting element. The imposing metal tank in pure \"Monster style\" helps to define a superior class of bike.Testastretta 11°The Monster 821 is powered by the Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine, with air injection system. A secondary air system similar to the one used on the 1199 Panigale has been introduced in order to optimise operation and reduce combustion cycle variability, without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of clean air is injected into the exhaust pipe, enabling total oxidation of the hot exhaust gases, efficiently cutting hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels. The Testastretta 11° engine fitted to the Monster 821 is an exclusive feature of these bikes and its structure has been engineered to be an integral element of the frame. In addition, the air filter and exhaust system have been designed to provide improved torque at low-medium engine speeds.The Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine generates power equal to 82.4 kW (112CV) @ 9,250 rpm and 89.4 Nm (9.1kgm) of torque at 7,750 rpm.Exhaust systemThe Testastretta 11° 821 engine is combined with a type 2-1-2 exhaust system, which leaves no room for doubt about the performance that the new Monster 821 is capable of unleashing.The engine control unit has a lambda probe for each individual cylinder, guaranteeing delivery of the right amount of fuel, while the stylish vertically stacked cannon silencers are equipped with catalytic converters that ensure compliance with Euro 4 standards. An electronically controlled mid-section adjustment valve optimises exhaust pressure according to engine speed.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Ducati\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: Monster 821 Dust Grey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U23446B\\n\\n',\n",

Where do you even start! For one thing, what you see is what you get. With a bike, nothing's hidden under a hood or behind doors. And that's especially true of a naked bike, a machine where you can see the engine and the frame and just about everything else.Bikes like these make sense they're light and elemental and pure. And they can also be a ton of fun. Especially a machine like the all-new 2018 Honda CB650FWhile you may not have seen this machine before, we've been refining it for several years over in Europe. Now it's your turn, and like a European supermodel, the CB650F is honed, toned and gorgeous.We started with the engine from our popular CBR650F. Offering an 11,000 rpm redline, we gave it shorter gear ratios to ensure some rigorous acceleration through the midrange. Revised intakes and a free-breathing exhaust mean more peak power too. In short, it's a blast to ride. And check out those 4-into-1 exhaust pipes a styling touch to one of the most iconic Hondas ever, the CB400F Supersport.Genuine middleweight four-cylinder motorcycles are an important Honda tradition, and bigger isn't always better. With the new CB650F you get more of what matters   performance, acceleration, style and handling ability   without adding weight or cost.Features may include:Power Up!The 649cc engine uses a compact internal architecture, stacked six-speed gearbox and starter/clutch layout with the cylinders canted forward 30. The DOHC 16-valve cylinder head employs direct cam actuation with a 11.4:1 compression ratio.Good BonesThe CB650F's steel diamond frame features twin 64mm x 30mm elliptical spars. They're stiffer around the headstock and more flexible in the middle of the spars to deliver balanced handling characteristics with high levels of feedback.New Showa Fork TechnologyA brand-new 41mm Showa Dual Bending Valve (SDBV) fork improves ride comfort and handling. It delivers proportional rebound damping with firmer compression damping as the travel increases.Information CentralThe dash offers twin digital screens. On the left are the rev-counter and speedometer; on the right are a fuel gauge, clock, odometer and the warning lights. Both sides are lit by a white backlight. Let Us Get You Approved!

Ever since then, the GSX-R750 has remained true to its original concept and championship-winning heritage. On the road or on the track, the GSX-R750 delivers a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, crisp handling, compact size and light weight. Its secret is an unequaled pairing of 750cc performance with the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600cc Supersport, complemented by technologically advanced suspension front and rear. Try a GSX-R750 and you’ll quickly realize this motorcycle defines performance riding from the center of the sportbike class.Built to own the racetrack and let loose on the streets. Since 1985, the GSX-R has been continuously refined to deliver new levels of performance and agility. This legacy of innovation continues with over 1 million legends madeFeatures may include:ENGINE\\tCompact 750cc 4-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio that produces remarkably strong high RPM power delivery.The energy efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) fuel injection uses eight, fine-spray 8-hole injectors for improved fuel atomization, which contributes to more complete combustion.An Engine Control Module (ECM) provides state-of-the-art engine management and has enhanced settings to suit the intake and exhaust systems, resulting in better fuel economy and linear throttle response.Advanced, MotoGP-developed transistorized ignition control programming helps maintain more precise spark timing across the range of engine speed and temperature range.CHASSISLightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum-alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that’s ready for race-track adaptation.Race-developed, lightweight SHOWA Big Piston front Forks (BPF) deliver superb feedback and consistent performance. Spring preload, rebound and compression damping are all fully adjustable.Single SHOWA rear shock features externally adjustable rebound and compression damping, along with adjustable ride height.Electronically controlled steering damper provides lighter steering at slower speeds and more damping force at racetrack and highway speeds.SUSPENSIONStylized Suzuki “S” 3-D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denotes the quality, sophistication and performance legacy of the brand.Optional single seat cowl can replace the passenger seat for an even more aggressive look or for use on solo rides, or track days.A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for GSX-R owners are available including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.12-month limited warranty.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Suzuki\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: GSX-R750\\n\\n\\n\\nMileage: 2625 mi\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U01909\\n\\n\\n\\nVIN: JS1GR7MA6H2101909\\n\\n',\n",

At the heart of the new Street 500 Dark Custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle, you've got an all-new 494cc, liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine. The liquid-cooled Revolution X V-Twin engine is built to thrive in the hot temperatures and stop and go traffic of the city grid. The new Street 500 Harley-Davidson custom motorcycle is an easy-to-ride motorcycle that's quick and nimble on city streets. The Street 500 from Harley-Davidson features and easy lock-to-lock sweep of the handlebars for quick turns and  moves. It has a low 24.5-inch seat height for an easy reach to the pavement  The suspension on the Street 500 Harley motorcycle is specially tuned for this motorcycle and built to handle rough urban infrastructure.  Like all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Street 500 motorcycle is pure, premium Harley-Davidson. The Revolution X engine and black two into one exhaust produce authentic Harley-Davidson sound. The teardrop tank and fenders are metal. And, of course, you've got premium Harley-Davidson paint and a chrome tank emblem. The Street 500 motorcycle is a Harley-Davidson Dark Custom motorcycle with a stripped down, blacked-out, street custom look. The new Revolution X engine is blacked-out. There's a black cafe style speed screen, black two into one exhaust, black fork gaiters  and black cast aluminum wheels.Features May Include:All-New Liquid-Cooled Revolution X EngineThe all-new liquid-cooled Revolution X engine that powers the Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle is 494 cubic centimeters of genuine Harley-Davidson V-Twin built to thrive in high temperatures and heavy traffic. Liquid-cooling means it maintains temperature and performance. Bring on the stop- and- go traffic. The Street 500 stays cool and ready to respond instantly to your throttle hand. And you can count on this: every cubic centimeter of the 494cc Revolution X engine is pure Harley-Davidson. 60 degree cylinder's. 4 valves per head. And plenty of low-end torque. You don't have to be winding the RPMs up to five figures to feel the strength and character of this engine. It's built to give you a soul-satisfying ride at the kind of RPMs you find yourself riding at on city streets.Six Speed TransmissionThe new Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle gives you six gears to work with when you're out tearing up the city streets. A smooth-shifting 6 speed transmission makes it easy to stay in the powerband when traffic is stop-and-go. And when the road opens up, sixth gear let's you drop the engine into a nice, easy groove for a long, comfortable ride at highway speeds.True Harley-Davidson SoundSome motorcycles make noise. The Harley-Davidson Street 500 motorcycle makes sound. The deep, thumping Harley-Davidson rumble that doesn't demand attention, but gets it anyway. We take the sound of every motorcycle we make very seriously. And tune it to perfection in our state-of-the-art sound facility in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin USA. When you hear the sound pouring out of the upswept muffler on the Street 500 model, you'll have no doubt we took the time to get it right. This is the note that instantly says Harley-Davidson. There is no mistaking it. Real, authentic and instantly credible on the street. Let Us Get You Approved!

The only upgrade is that I JUST installed Vance & Hines slip-on mufflers which sound fantastic, and a chrome 5 rail HD luggage rack. Bike has the 103 ci engine with the 6 speed transmission, HD quick-detach windshield, ABS, and the saddlebags have stiffeners around the top, keeping them looking as good as new.

And the all-new Africa Twin is the bike that will let you live those dreams. With a name made famous from Paris to Dakar and beyond, it has renowned reliability, the latest technology, and unsurpassed capability, allowing you to wander as far as your imagination allows.Features may include:PERFORMANCEParallel Twin Engine LayoutThe Africa Twin's parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.Tapered Aluminum HandlebarAnother example of fitting premium equipment to the Africa Twin wherever we can, the aluminum handlebar is much lighter than a steel unit. The design tapers from a thinner diameter under your grips to a fatter section at the bar-top clamp, and is fine-tuned for optimal flex and rigidity.Tires and wheelsReal adventure bikes use spoked wheels because they better survive the dings and hits of off-road riding. The Africa Twin  uses a 21-inch front and an 18-inch rear for superior performance, especially when it comes to off-road riding.BrakesWith a pair of 310mm wave-rotor front disc brakes and a single 256mm wave disc in the rear, the Africa Twin offers up ample stopping power in all conditions.Four-piston CalipersUp front, the Africa Twin features twin four-piston brake calipers for powerful braking performance. The radial-mount design also helps make them stiffer, increasing brake feel and control.Unicam Engine DesignHonda's exclusive Unicam engine design helps us give the Africa Twin a compact cylinder head for optimal engine placement. But the engine also benefits from superior performance, thanks to the entire cylinder-head layout. It's the best of both worlds!Twin IntakesThe Africa Twin uses a unique twin air-intake design with twin vertical filtration elements. This gives you excellent engine performance with plenty of clean air, even under dusty conditions.COMFORTRally WindscreenDeveloped from our racing experience in the Dakar Rally, the Africa Twin's windscreen helps shield you from the wind and the elements, especially during long miles of high-speed touring. At lower speeds, the clear construction gives you better visibility off road.Narrow Riding PositionAdventure riding is an active sport, and that means you need to be able to move around on your bike naturally and athletically. The Africa Twin is extremely narrow where you sit, and the peg-bar-seat triangle lets you move up and forward and far back as well, to enhance handling, especially under demanding trail conditions.Adjustable SeatThe Africa Twin offers an adjustable two-position rider's seat. This makes reaching the ground easier, and also lets you fine-tune your riding environment in respect to the footpeg and handlebar placement.Biaxial CounterbalanceBy using counterbalancing elements on two axes, Honda's engineers can cancel out both primary and coupling vibrations from the engine. The result is that we can mount the engine solidly for superior strength and handling, yet you still get an extraordinarily smooth, vibration-free ride.HANDLING43-degree steering lockWith 43 degrees of steering lock both left and right, the Africa Twin provides excellent maneuverability on tight trails. This is one of the reasons the Africa Twin feels so much more nimble than many of the other bigger adventure bikes out there. Let Us Get You Approved!

Over 96% approval rating with cash down. \\n2017 Ducati Monster 821 Dust GreyUnmistakably Monster112 HP Testastretta 11° engine, razor sharp handling, state of the art safety equipment,Riding Modes and unmistakable Ducati sound. Sport performance, Italian design and unique personality: Monster 821, essentially Monster.*The power values indicated above are measured using a chassis dynamometer. Homologated power data, as quoted in the Bike Registration Document, are measured using an engine dynamometer according to the homologation regulation. The two power values may differ because of the different measurement equipments.ConceptForms and functionalities.The performance and fluidity of the new  Testastretta 11°, the versatility of the three Riding Modes, the comfort  of the adjustable seat and the passenger handles make the Monster 821 the ideal bike for every occasion. With Monster, the design is unmistakably that of an icon. The fun has no limits.DesignIt takes just a glance to see all of the elements that contribute to creating the legendary Monster: the muscular, sporty line, the rounded front headlight flanked by the forks, the high number plate, the compact yet imposing metal fuel tank. The unmistakable \"minimalist\" design that gives you the impression of being in front of an engine, a frame, a tank, a seat, and nothing more.Despite its larger size, which offers unprecedented performance and versatility, the Monster\\'s proportions immediately reveal the heart of a sports bike. The mass is visually concentrated at the front and the engine area looks compact, even with the new water cooling system, into which the radiator and the water supply pipes have been cleverly incorporated. The engine is combined with an impressive side-mounted staggered exhaust system that leaves no room for doubt about the bike\\'s performance.The new Monster 821 clearly spells sophistication, modernity and substance thanks to its avant-garde technology and top-quality materials. Ducati\\'s traditional trellis frame has evolved, using a typical sports bike solution, in which the engine is the supporting element. The imposing metal tank in pure \"Monster style\" helps to define a superior class of bike.Testastretta 11°The Monster 821 is powered by the Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine, with air injection system. A secondary air system similar to the one used on the 1199 Panigale has been introduced in order to optimise operation and reduce combustion cycle variability, without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of clean air is injected into the exhaust pipe, enabling total oxidation of the hot exhaust gases, efficiently cutting hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels. The Testastretta 11° engine fitted to the Monster 821 is an exclusive feature of these bikes and its structure has been engineered to be an integral element of the frame. In addition, the air filter and exhaust system have been designed to provide improved torque at low-medium engine speeds.The Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine generates power equal to 82.4 kW (112CV) @ 9,250 rpm and 89.4 Nm (9.1kgm) of torque at 7,750 rpm.Exhaust systemThe Testastretta 11° 821 engine is combined with a type 2-1-2 exhaust system, which leaves no room for doubt about the performance that the new Monster 821 is capable of unleashing.The engine control unit has a lambda probe for each individual cylinder, guaranteeing delivery of the right amount of fuel, while the stylish vertically stacked cannon silencers are equipped with catalytic converters that ensure compliance with Euro 4 standards. An electronically controlled mid-section adjustment valve optimises exhaust pressure according to engine speed.\\nVehicle Details\\n\\n\\n\\nYear: 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMake: Ducati\\n\\n\\n\\nModel: Monster 821 Dust Grey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStock #: U23446B\\n\\n',\n",

At the very top of the mountain in terms of power, features and riding experience, this is the motorcycle you'll find.The 2014 Harley-Davidson CVO Limited model is a high-end performance motorcycle with Twin Cam 110 power that gives you the ultimate in premium featured touring. As part of Project RushMore for 2014, the CVO Limited has been redesigned from the ground up for more comfort, more power, better braking and handling and more classic style. The iconic batwing H-D fairing has been totally redesigned to reduce head buffeting. This bike is powered by a new Harley High Output Twin Cam 110 Engine with Screamin' Eagle badges. The new high-output Twin Cam 110 engine with Screamin' Eagle badges provides 110 cubic inches of power, a low cruising rpm, more low end torque, more passing power, along with silky smooth shifting of its 6-speed cruise drive transmission. The H-D CVO Limited motorcycle features the new Reflex anti-lock braking system (ABS) with dynamically, electronically linked brakes for optimum braking in all conditions. This big V-Twin Cam 110 performance motorcycle is custom touring at its finest. We've added more room for the passenger. For an ultra comfortable ride the seat is heated. Take a good look at all of the premium features and components of this bike, including the Harley-Davidson Twin Cam 110 engine with Screamin' Eagle badges and upgraded Boom! Box 6.5 infotainment system with it's 6.5  full color screen.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - EngineAs every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we've been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson engine.New Boom! Box 6.5GT RadioLet's start with the big news: 25% more volume for your tunes. The new Boom! Box 6.5GT Radio puts out 75 watts per channel at 1% distortion and features a factory-tuned, optimized equalizer that pumps out more power and can be played louder while maintaining the clarity of your sound. And the new speed tuning system delivers more than just volume changes at different speeds. It changes the level of bass and treble to dial-in the best sound, whether you're running at stately pace down the strip or going hell for leather down an open stretch of road.Project RUSHMORE - ConfidenceHere are some of the innovations The Rider Project led to: the new Reflex Linked Brakes with Anti-lock Braking System. New dual halogen and LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a new steering head with stiffer front forks.

Motorcycling has never been about blending in or being one of the herd. And that's especially true in the world of cruisers and customs. But we think a bike has to work as good as it looks, and that's what really sets the Honda Fury apart. Wanna turn some heads? The Fury is guaranteed to do that. But it's also for riders who want a machine that they can cruise on all day long, that doesn't spend its life in the service bay. Long, lean and mean, stretching nearly six feet from axle to axle, this is an outrageous testimony to the builder's art. And the power and sound coming from its big 1312cc V-twin? Pure music. With clean, crisp lines few customs ever achieve, the Fury is as eye-catching when it's stopped as when it's rolling down the highway. One ride, and you'll be hooked.Features may include:InnovationsBrakesA single powerful 336mm-diameter front-disc brake is complemented by a 296mm brake disc in back. An ABS version is also available.Long RakeA raked-out front end and condensed, hard-tail look to the rear, plus a stretched wheelbase. And that long wheelbase is no illusion the Fury stretches a full 71.2 inches between axles.High-Tensile Steel FrameThe Fury's high-tensile steel frame is the centerpiece to this machine's open, minimalist chopper styling. It's functional too, delivering smooth ride quality and responsive handling.Chopper StylingThe Fury is one of the most authentic, radically styled custom motorcycles that Honda has ever produced. It features a teardrop seamless fuel tank, an ingenious single-shock rear suspension system and an aluminum swingarm.Fuel InjectionForget about fiddling with a choke the Fury's fuel-injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes.1300cc V-Twin EngineA powerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.Low SeatThe Fury's super-low 26.7-inch seat height is an integral design element that fits in behind the slim and long fuel tank.Shaft Final DriveThe shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.ExhaustThe Fury's engine features specially designed camshafts that also add to the unique V-twin sound and power-pulse exhaust sensations.Unique Wheels and TiresA fat 200-series rear tire is paired with a slim 21-inch front tire, both wrapped around distinctive alloy wheels.

Huge changes are going to jump out at you. First is the CRF450R's all-new air-fork front suspension. Nearly two pounds lighter than a coil-spring fork, it offers easier adjustment, less internal friction, and even better handling. Next, an all-new twin-spar aluminum frame. You'll see some big changes in the steering-head area. That's because the frame is designed specifically to work with the new fork.Check out the CRF450R's short radical new twin exhaust. The system moves the mufflers in way closer to the bike's center of mass. They're super short and compact, and work in perfect concert with the 2013 model's new bodywork to make this the most flickable CRF450R ever!In fact, everywhere you look you're going to see upgrades this year: The engine gets a new piston shape, porting, and valve timing, along with more compression for more power. The radiators are smaller and flow more air. The clutch is totally redesigned with six springs for better feel at the lever. Even the footpegs and tires get the Honda touch.Without a doubt, the 2013 CRF 450R is the most dialed-in bike and still the lightest weight in its class. Do your part, and you're going to be a permanent fixture on the podium with this one. Let Us Get You Approved!

       " \"\\n\\nQR Code Link to This Post\\n\\n\\nOriginal, excellent condition. Two owners. I acquired bike in 2001 and have owned it since. Well maintained. The only mods are a Corbin seat, Nology coils, and a DynoJet kit (I have the original seat and parts). Always garaged in climate controlled setting. The odometer is in the mid 13k range (about 500 miles per year). Rated at 147 hp. This is your chance to own a vintage head-turner without the need to restore any cosmetics or mechanicals. It is fast and attracts a lot of attention. Tires have about 1500 miles on them. Bike was never tracked or abused. This survivor could be the nicest example around. I am selling to ease into a more sedate ride. I have extras which include new OEM ECU, Heli Bars, and new OEM windscreen. Clear title. No rides without cash on the table. I don't need help selling the bike and prefer cash as payment.    \",\n",

So when we built the new Softail Slim S, we loaded it up with the most powerful engine you can get in a cruiser this year.American MuscleWe've taken everything that was great about the Softail Slim and added a little more. For starters, we've added power with a Screamin' Eagle Air-Cooled Twin Cam 110B engine. We've taken the military theme even further with an awesome Olive Gold Denim paint option and made the rest black to the core. Black triple clamp and riser, gloss black headlamp ring, fork slider covers and lower forks. Black brake levers, mirrors and black over/under shotgun exhaust with slash cut muffler. Every inch is modern power with old iron attitude.Features may include:Authentic StylingGet an eyeful of a Softail motorcycle and you see more than some weepy-eyed exercise in nostalgia. You're looking at the kind of style that has the power to defy time. Honest. Uncluttered. Unaffected by the fad of the moment. There's a good reason for this.Iconic EngineThe air-cooled 45 V-Twin engine at the heart of every Softail model is a prime example of what makes a Harley-Davidson motorcycle more satisfying than anything else. Its clean, uncluttered shape fits perfectly in the downtubes of the frame. Twist the throttle and the surge of torque hits you exactly where it counts.TechnologyThe beauty of the technology on a Softail motorcycle is that it never looks technological. That didn't happen by accident and it doesn't come easy, particularly when you consider that the inspiration for the family is the clean, wide-open lines of a vintage hardtail.HandlingIf you've never experienced a Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle, it's time to find out what you've been missing. The venerable Softail frame has logged untold millions of miles, and we've put every one of them to good use.ComfortThe authentic look of a Softail motorcycle comes from the days before anyone knew much about building a suspension. The rigid hardtail frames of yesteryear had a pure, uncluttered look that riders still love. Let Us Get You Approved!

With boosted engine power and a suite of rider-assist features, this restyled GSX-S750 is ready to capture hearts and turn heads as the new leader in its class.This is the perfect sportbike response to the craving of today's discriminating riders, this new GSX-S750 looks better and outperforms its popular predecessor   and other entries in the class. It is nimble, comfortable, and an exhilarating, fun ride.Features may include:New fuel-injected, 749cc, 4-cylinder engine uses GSX-R architecture to deliver a torque-rich sportbike experience.Suzuki Advanced Traction Control* lets the rider select sensitivity to match road conditions.The unique chassis integrates the best qualities of a tubular streetbike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame, and is fitted with KYB suspension to provide precise handling.ENGINEPotent 749cc 4-cylinder fuel-injected engine uses 2005 GSX-R750 architecture so the power delivery is an excellent bled of strong low-end and a muscular top end.Using the K5 generation GSX-R engine architecture also permits a shorter chassis which greatly enhances handling. This also makes the GSX-S750 the only motorcycle in its class with an engine with SuperSport lineage.Ventilation holes are added to the bottom side of each cylinder in the GSX-S750's crankcase. The holes reduce pumping loss to help produce power and gain fuel economy.TRANSMISSIONThe race-proven six-speed close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine length.The shorter final gear ratio enables the new GSX-S750 accelerate quicker than the prior model while the additional engine power maintains the same top speed potential.Large diameter, wet multi-plate clutch is derived from a GSX-R750 design to easily transmit power while the rack and pinion clutch release provides the rider with superb friction-point feel.CHASSISWith styling influenced by the GSX-S1000, but with its own aggressive turn, the GSX-S750's new bodywork looks wild and forceful, yet keeps the rider comfortable at all times.The new headlight nacelle houses provides a visual focal point while the under cowl connects the chassis styling to the engine and new exhaust system.Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular-style street bike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A reasonable sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests and seat. Let Us Get You Approved!

The Harley Street Glide FLHX model has a 2-1-2 exhaust. Check out all of the H-D Street Glide FLHX model's specs and features and see why this bike is meant for motorcycle touring. Take a look at more of the Harley-Davidson touring motorcycles including the motorcycle luggage storage capacity of the Electra Glide Classic model or the Road Glide Ultra model ideal for motorcycle travel.Classic Fuel TankPart of the unmistakable style of the Harley-Davidson Street Glide motorcycle is plenty of room for showing off your paint. This classically styled, bold six-gallon fuel tank doesn't just give you a bigger canvas for premium or custom paint; it holds six gallons of go so you can eat up a lot more road between pit stops. We know fuel economy is important but so is style. Sharp, eye-catching colors and precision-crafted Harley-Davidson tank medallions complete the unique look of this tough bagger.Twin Cam 103 Engine HeritageThe knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103 engine. We painstakingly perfected every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson's unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution, Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 96 engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two wheels.Harman/Kardon Advanced Audio SystemNaturally, the king of the road gets some royal extras. The premium two-speaker, 20-watt per channel Harman/Kardon audio system boasts great sound for booming down the boulevard and highway, and, yeah, it might as well go to 11. It's loud, proud and comes with AM/FM receiver and accommodates a CD or MP3 player. Riding free just wouldn't be the same without the right soundtrack.Dunlop Multi-Tread TiresThe 180mm back tire is engineered to do more than fill out the rear fender and put a bigger patch of rubber on the road. Dunlop Multi-Tread technology uses harder compounds at the center and softer on the sides for a tire that still knows how to knuckle-down on corners. Perfect for making this bike agile on every curvy stretch of road. And the way it feels going through an abrupt off-camber turn will put a grin on your face that'll last to the next state line.Two-Up SeatingModern styling and comfort that doesn't sacrifice an ounce of nostalgic style: This ultimate Touring saddle features a sculpted seat with a deeper contoured bucket and narrower neck, to relieve pressure on your thighs, while providing more back support and comfort for a wide variety of rider sizes. And the lower seat height 26.1 inches to be exact puts your feet closer to the road to enhance your confidence. Additionally, the leather trim and premium stitching accentuate the advanced ergonomics while giving the seat that sharp detail you only find on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It's science in service of comfort, and your way to beat fatigue over the long haul. Let Us Get You Approved!

It's an utterly stunning head-turner, and one look will tell you why: Blacked-out 745 cc V-twin engine and black rims sporting matte silver highlights, bobbed fenders, spoke wheels, and beefy front fork. Then the exhaust note hits you, a deep, throaty pulse rumbling from dual exhausts. It's hard to resist, we know. And downright impossible once you've seen its price tag. And best of all, the Shadow Phantom gets an estimated 56 miles per gallon! Sometimes a whisper is way louder than a shout. And that's most definitely the case with the Shadow Phantom.

Make the ride a cosmic leap beyond anything the rider has experienced in terms of function and comfort. So here we are countless miles later. And everything we’ve learned has been built into these Project RUSHMORE machines. One-touch saddlebags, GPS and infotainment, better airflow around the rider, more passing power, the list goes on. And we did it all with out letting the soul of the machine get lost in gadgetry. To see how far it’s all come, check out this machine that bears the Electra Glide name for 2016.\\n\\nFeatures may include:\\nControl\\nProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.\\n\\nInfotainment\\nWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.\\n\\nStyle\\nWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.\\n\\nStop by or call the House of Harley-Davidson today! \\n*Price does not include CPO, Doc & License Fees; Subject to prior sale\\n',\n",

Premium quality materials and refined finishing blend with top-level technology in the S version to bring the most unique and unmatched design to life. Guarded at the heart of the motorcycle, the new Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 engine is the undeniable centrepiece. Shiny and black with machined details in full view, ready to deliver terrific torque throughout the rev range.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\nLocation: Denali HD – Wasilla\\nCondition: Pre-owned\\nStock Number: 002154\\nYear: 2016\\nMake: Ducati\\nModel: XDiavel S\\nVehicle Type: Motorcycle\\nCategory: Cruiser\\nMileage: 3,237 miles\\nEngine: Liquid-Cooled Testastretta DVT 1262\\nColor: Thrilling Black\\n\\n\\nExtras on this bike:\\n\\nTermignoni Exhaust System\\nLow Miles!\\n\\n\\nThis is X\\nXDiavel represents the merger of two worlds: that of the cruiser for long, low speed relaxing journeys, and that of the Ducati, characterised by Italian style, technical sophistication and very high performance. The X of XDiavel is just that: the crossover between apparently differing and distant worlds, united in a single bike, a synthesis where both are fully realised without any compromises.\\n\\nLow speed excitement\\nDucati is joining the cruiser world, doing so in its own particular way, by presenting a real cruiser but with the design, technological content and performance typical of the bikes of Borgo Panigale. XDiavel is \"low speed excitement\", where a relaxed low speed is typical of the cruiser world, while the excitement and adrenaline of sports riding are the very values of Ducati.\\n\\nDesign\\nLong, low, muscular, with modern shapes and technologically advanced systems. But above all sexy. A bike designed with the cruiser world in mind but also with Ducati DNA, steering the cruiser concept into modern times, and the future, a real \"Technocruiser\".\\n\\nTestastretta DVT 1262\\nThe twin-cylinder Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 is a completely new and Euro 4 approved engine which uses the Desmodromic Variable Timing system. The increase in engine capacity compared to the Testastretta 1200, together with the use of the Desmodromic Variable Timing system, has enabled supply of incredibly full and at the same time fluid torque at low running speeds, while also guaranteeing sports performance when the throttle is fully opened. In addition, the Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262 has a particularly detailed design which, thanks to the repositioning of the water pump inside the V of the cylinders, does away with the cooling system pipes on the left side.\\n\\nBelt transmission\\nThe XDiavel is the first Ducati to use belt final drive. A must in the cruiser world, the system was developed for the XDiavel by Ducati engineers so as to be able to guarantee reliable and safe transmission of the power supplied by the Ducati Testastretta DVT 1262. The advantages of the belt are the low noise level, cleaning, reduced maintenance and fluid response to opening the gas, as befits a real cruiser.\\n\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

This engine provides a unique power character, with outstanding low- to mid-range torque and very linear throttle response, combined with strong high-rpm pulling power. This motor develops 50 foot pounds of torque and is designed to maximize riding excitement in the real world.\\n\\nCrossplane Concept\\nThe 2-cylinder engine features Yamaha’s “Crossplane Concept” 270-degree crank that provides linear torque development in response to the rider’s throttle input. The CP2® engine is also light, slim and compact and offers an excellent level of rider/machine communication.\\n\\nOffset Cylinder Block\\nThe CP2 engine shifts its cylinder bores slightly forward of the crankshaft axis, towards the exhaust side. This offset reduces piston to cylinder wall friction, for more power and improved fuel economy.\\n\\nChassis/Suspension:\\nRefined Front Fork\\nThe front suspension features a 41mm fork with 5.1 inches of travel, with new spring rates and damping settings for a more refined suspension feel and improved performance across a wide range of riding styles.\\n\\nUpgraded Monocross® Shock\\nThe MT-07 features an all-new, link-type Monocross shock, now adjustable for both rebound damping and spring preload, for improved tuneability, with settings developed to match the upgraded front fork. The shock provides 5.1 inches of rear travel, and is positioned below the seat with an almost horizontal alignment, which helps make the chassis much more compact.\\n\\nCompact Frame Design\\nA lightweight, high-strength steel frame provides an optimized rigidity balance for nimble, agile handling. The engine is a stressed member of the chassis, allowing a lighter, more compact main frame design and a total wet weight of only 403 lb.\\n\\nAdditional\\nSleek New Bodywork\\nThe MT-07 features a refined new style to match the rest of the MT family, including an angular new headlight, more aggressive intake scoops, a sleeker fuel tank cover, and a new layered tail design featuring a more compact LED tail light.\\n\\nErgonomically Designed Fuel Tank\\nThe slim 3.7 gallon fuel tank is both stylish and compact to provide excellent comfort and knee grip area, while still permitting easier planting of both feet on the ground, for added rider confidence at stops.\\n\\nAdvanced Instrumentation\\nThe compact full-LCD instrument panel includes a digital bar-type tachometer display with gear position indicator, digital speedometer, odometer, dual trip meters, fuel gauge, fuel reserve trip meter, clock, instant and average fuel consumption and a range of warning and indicator lights.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.\\n\\nInfotainment\\nWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.\\n\\nStyle\\nWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.\\n\\nSTREET INSPIRED PAINT\\nWe created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.\\n\\nLOW SEAT & SLAMMED SUSPENSION\\nThe combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you\\'re dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.\\n\\nTUCK AND ROLL SEAT\\nA solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.\\n\\nMACHINED 9-SPOKE WHEELS\\nNine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.\\n\\n883CC AIR-COOLED EVOLUTION® ENGINE\\nAuthentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.\\n\\nDRAG-STYLE HANDLEBAR\\nBorn at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, License and Doc fees.\\n    ',\n",

The Softail® Deluxe comes with optional Hard Candy Custom™ paint, a large metal flake paint finish that recalls the iconic styling of \\'70s custom bikes, and offers blazing color showing through a deep, finish. The Harley® fenders on the Softail® Deluxe model are true retro style with their long lines and chrome Harley® fender tips. And each fender says Deluxe so everyone will know how you roll. The Harley® Softail® Deluxe model has a wide front end fork and gorgeous 7 inch ball motorcycle headlamp. Whitewall tires give this motorcycle cruiser a 1950s boulevard retro motorcycle look. The H-D® Softail® Deluxe model features a powerful air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley® engine with 6 speed cruise drive transmission, providing more performance power for passing, hill-climbing, and riding with passenger and luggage. Hit the road in style with this classic two up FLSTN Softail® Deluxe model\\'s seat. At a lowdown 24.5 inches, it\\'s among the lowest seat heights you\\'ll find. And we\\'ve added some ergonomics to make riding solo or duo even easier, especially for riders with a shorter inseam. \\'Collapsing\\' sides create a narrow seat profile, and the passenger seat pillion is detachable.\\n\\nFeatures may include:\\nHidden Rear Shocks\\nIf you want a comfortable bike but love that rigid-suspension look, you\\'ve come to the right bike. We\\'ve kept all the modern comforts where they belong--below the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage \"hardtail\" frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It\\'s a signature rigid look, and you\\'ll only find it on a Softail® model.\\n\\nTank-Mounted Console\\nA big, bold speedometer and odometer display, along with an ancillary display for gear and rpm, offer up the information you need on the fly.\\n\\nTwin Cam 103™ Engine Innovation\\nFire up the Twin Cam 103™ engine and feel the low-end torque unleashed. Thanks to the lightweight piston design, delivery of the added power is more refined than ever. Then put your foot on the shifter and feel how the engine and Six-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission were designed to work together. Six speeds. A strong driveline and strong internal parts. Low routine maintenance. And a low cruising rpm couldn\\'t feel better.\\n\\nStandard Anti-Lock Brakes\\nWhen it comes to the Softail® Deluxe model with ABS, \"stopping power\" has a double meaning. The components of our ABS are tastefully hidden within the wheel hub, so you\\'ll still turn heads with clean, streamlined design. More importantly, though, you get certainty in the saddle knowing your bike\\'s going to behave when you need it.\\n\\nDunlop® Tires\\nWhether you\\'re crossing state lines or staying within city limits, you want a confident feeling of sure contact with the road. The front end holds a premium touring tire with a three-ply polyester casing and two fiberglass belts. The back cruiser tire has an advanced tread pattern. Made from a specifically formulated compound, it delivers outstanding grip in wet or dry weather. And since they\\'re from Dunlop®, you know you\\'re wrapping your premium rollers in quality rubber.\\n\\nFull-Length Rider Footboards\\nYour boots were made for riding, in any way you see fit. Our full-length footboards boast a tried and true design that\\'s stood the test of time. Plenty of foot positions for your taste and comfort. Rubber vibration isolation for a comfortable ride. And heel-toe shifting for confident shifting every time. It takes a few rides, but once you\\'ve gotten used to the smooth heel-toe rhythm, you\\'ll never give it up.    ',\n",

This is the hot rod bagger decked out fender to fender with Premium BOOM!™ Audio Sound, infotainment, custom details and mind-blowing paint.\\n\\nFeatures May Include:\\nProject RUSHMORE - Control\\nHere are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there’s wet pavement. We’ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we’ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.\\n\\nProject RUSHMORE - Infotainment\\nMore sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Or as more than one rider asked: “Why can’t the infotainment system on my motorcycle blow away the ones the car companies put in their cars?” We couldn’t agree more. Check out the infotainment system Project RUSHMORE brought to the sport of motorcycling. You won’t believe your eyes. Or ears.\\n\\nProject RUSHMORE - Feel\\nWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Airflow, heat management, seat textures, legroom and hand controls all went under the hard microscope of the road and got tested and re-tested by real riders and worked and re-worked by us until we were satisfied we had built the most comfortable machines on the road. We all want to go farther, and when you\\'re more comfortable in the saddle, you can.\\n\\nExclusive CVO™ Motorcycle Enhancements\\nAll the quality. All the legacy of the Harley-Davidson name. Plus custom touches and performance that distinguish you from every other bike on the road. Sure there\\'s a little vanity. Premium custom. Big, tricked-out wheels. Deep attention to details. The perfect storm of engineering and style you\\'ll only find on a custom machine. And you\\'ll spoil yourself with the accessories—from comfort to electronics to chrome. But the real signature of a Harley-Davidson® Custom Vehicle Operations™ motorcycle is the explosive power and sleek detailing of the huge Twin Cam 110™ engine with Screamin\\' Eagle® engine badges. It\\'s custom-built, not just for anyone, but for true connoisseurs of the road.\\nWhy become part of the Denali Harley-Davidson Family? \\n\\nOur operating philosophy is to focus on you.

See you soon at Denali Harley-Davidson.\\n\\n\\n2016 Harley-Davidson® FLTRU - Road Glide® Ultra\\n\\nNew for 2016, this one will roll out of the factory doors and never stop until it catches the horizon. Experience world-class aero comfort and BOOM!™ Box 6.5 GT Audio in our new ultimate mile-eater.\\nA ride that could make a continent feel too small.\\n\\nIf your dream is to go big, this could be the one for you. The Road Glide® Ultra motorcycle combines the most wind-cheating fairing ever devised with the full complement of Harley-Davidson Project RUSHMORE touring features. You get a Tour-Pak® luggage carrier and saddlebags that open with one hand. The top of the line Project RUSHMORE infotainment system. A Twin Cooled Twin Cam 103™ engine. And mind-blowingly comfortable ride for your passenger. All built around the aggressive look of the Road Glide. Call the house sitter.\\n\\nFeatures may include:\\nControl\\nProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It\\'s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.\\n\\nInfotainment\\nWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you\\'re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.\\n\\nStyle\\nWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren\\'t just motorcycles. They\\'re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\nLocation: Denali HD - Wasilla\\nCondition: Certified Pre-owned\\nStock Number: 636657\\nYear: 2016\\nMake: Harley-Davidson®\\nModel: FLTRU - Road Glide® Ultra\\nVehicle Type: Motorcycle\\nCategory: Touring\\nMileage: 14,768 miles\\nEngine: Air-Cooled High Output Twin Cam 103™\\nColor: Billet Silver/Vivid Black Two-Tone\\n\\n\\nPrice displayed does not include CPO, DOC & DMV Fees\\n ',\n",

The SG250 returns with NEW features in 2020.\\n\\nThe CSC SG250 San Gabriel reminds us why we love to ride. The SG250 is equipped with a proven 230cc, air-cooled counter-balanced engine. CSC has brought back the café racer, equipped with everything you need – and nothing you don’t!\\n\\nThe 230cc motor used in the SG250 (and the CSC TT250 Enduro) is a modernized version of the “world-design” motorcycle engine first developed back in 1975. A new motorcycle engine was developed that was specifically designed to require minimal maintenance.\\n\\nThere are two main categories of CSC SG250 San Gabriel owners. There are riders who are buying their first motorcycle. These riders appreciate the nimble handling and performance of the 230cc engine in the lightweight chassis.\\n\\nThe second (and largest) category of SG250 San Gabriel owners are experienced bikers who already own several motorcycles. The café racer-style is streamlined, minimalist, and retro. Experienced riders are attracted to the SG250 because of what it ISN’T. The SG250 San Gabriel isn’t high-tech. No electronic suspension; no surround-sound stereo; no trip computer; and no hassles! Just turn the key and ride – OR stomp the kick starter for another reminder of a simpler time!\\n\\nBOTH categories love the LOW price: the 2020 CSC SG250 is available NEW, including a 12-month unlimited mileage warranty, for ONLY $2,295.00. Plus Fee's.\\nFlat rate shipping to all of Hawaii for only $395.00!!\\n\\nThe CSC SG250 San Gabriel is faithful to the appearance of the old bikes, but also well-equipped with important features like 17-inch tires on aluminum rims, full instrumentation including a digital speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, gear indicator, and neutral light. You have inverted front forks and adjustable rear reservoir shocks. Stopping power is provide by a huge front and rear disc brakes.\\n\\nOld bikes can't compete with the 2020 CSC SG250 that includes an LED headlight, LED brake light and turn signals, 300-watt alternator, a 2-person seat plus rubber-cushioned foot pegs for driver and passenger, and even a locking gas cap – all as STANDARD equipment!\\n\\nThe SG250 is an unmatched value. The proven dependable and economical 230cc motor is paired with a huge list of standard features that cannot be duplicated for TWICE the price!\\n\\nCSC SG250 San Gabriel Standard Features:\\n\\n•230cc air-cooled engine, overhead valve, with counter-balancer\\n•Fuel system: Keima slide carburetor\\n•Long maintenance intervals and easy repairs backed by a full Owner’s Manual and online service tutorials\\n•5-speed transmission\\n•Starters: electric and kick starter\\n•Stainless steel megaphone steel exhaust\\n•4-gallon fuel tank with locking gas cap - keyed to ignition\\n•LED headlight with halo ring.\\n•Dash with digital speedometer , tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, gear indicator, neutral light, turn signal, high beam indicators, passing light switch\\n•LED brake light, LED turn signals\\n•300-Watt alternator\\n•Inverted front forks , front fork lock\\n•Adjustable dual rear shock absorbers with reservoirs\\n•Large diameter front disc and rear disc brakes\\n•Front 90/71/17 spoked wheel with DOT tire and tube, black aluminum rim\\n•Rear 120/70/17 spoked wheel with DOT tire and tube, black aluminum rim\\n•Large diameter front and rear disc brakes\\n•Black low handlebars with bar-end weights\\n•Dual rear-view mirrors\\n•Comfort seat for driver and passenger\\n•Side stand and center stand\\n•Available Colors: Matt Black or Metallic Sliver, Pearl White, Matt OD Green.\\n\\nThe 2020 CSC SG250 San Gabriel is available for ONLY $2,295.00, (Price plus $400 Prep and Doc fees) for more info visit CSCMOTORCYCLES.COM or give us a call.    \",\n",

Its thunderous 1700cc V-Twin, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected powerplant has an Electronic Throttle Valve (ETV), four-valve heads, a six-speed transmission, hydraulic clutch and fi nal belt drive. Additionally the Vaquero has rider-reassuring Kawasaki Advanced Coactive-braking Technology (K-ACT) ABS.Features may include:Rider CockpitWith a color-matched inner fairing and distinctive gauge inserts, the rider’s view of the Vaquero lends itself to the scenery of the open road. Small locking glove boxes on each side of the fairing provide secure storage for garage door openers, sunglasses and other necessary items. Large, powerful speakers deliver sound from the versatile stereo, and all the necessary information is displayed to the rider via classically-styled analog gauges and a high-tech LCD display panel.Rock Star StylingThe 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan 1700 Vaquero ABS looks cool from every angle, but a glance at the rear section of the bike tells quite a story. A wide rear fender covers a 170/70-16 rear tire for a beefy, tough appearance. Tightly-mounted saddlebags keep the profi le slim, and a slick LED taillight adds even more chrome to the rear, complementing the dual exhausts and the unmistakable V-Twin engine.Get Pre-Approved for Financing:↳ Apply at the link below:http://adrlnmsaz.post2cl.com/financing.php➡ For more information on this unit:↳ Go To the link below:http://adrlnmsaz.post2cl.com/details.php?vehicleid=2164667Details:Year: 2015Make: *Kawasaki*Model: *Vulcan 1700 Vaquero ABS*Mileage: 0Stock #: U06690~ 2015 *Kawasaki* *Vulcan 1700 Vaquero ABS*.is located and easily accessible near the following cities: *Tucson AZ* *Oro Valley AZ* *Green Valley AZ* *Marana AZ* *Sahuarita AZ* *Tubac AZ* *Amado AZ* *Sonoita AZ* *Huachuca City AZ* *Sierra Vista AZ* *St David AZ* *Tombstone AZ* *Bisbee AZ* *Dragoon AZ* *Suncity AZ* *Three Points AZ* *Catilina Foothills AZ* *Oracle AZ* *Sam Manuel AZ* *Arizona City Eloy AZ* *Casa Grande AZ* *Coolige AZ* *Pima County AZ* *Maricopa County AZ* *San Tan Valley AZ* *Chandler AZ* *Mesa AZ* *East Phoenix AZ* *North Phoenix AZ* *West Phoenix AZ* *Central Phoenix AZ* *Peoria AZ* *Glendale AZ* *Globe AZ* *Apache Junction AZ* *Scottsdale AZ* *Fountain Hills AZ* *Nogales AZ* *Duncan AZ*. *Front Wheel Drive* *All Wheel Drive* *4 Doors* *Doors* *Bad Credit* *Bankruptcy* *First time buyer* *no credit* *For Sale* *Clean* *Cheap* *Used* *pre-owned* *Like New* *fair* *good* *great*. *AWD* *front wheel drive* *4 wheel drive* *4x4*. *2005* *2006* *2007* *2008* *2009* *2010* *2011* *2012* *2013* *2014* *2015* *2016* *2017* *2018* *2019* *2020* . *all prices* *all makes* *all models* *all years*. 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020   Bad Credit Bankruptcy First time buyer no credit For Sale Clean Cheap Used pre-owned Like New fair good great.

The bike’s special appearance, strong performance, and comfortable riding posture set it apart from other middleweight sportbikes, and many of those competitors cost considerably more to purchase and own.As with the GSX-S1000, this GSX-S750 ABS inherits its heart and soul from Suzuki’s MotoGP race experience and the 30-year heritage of the GSX-R750. With strong, torque-rich engine power and a suite of rider-assist features, this GSX-S750 ABS is ready to capture hearts and turn heads as the performance value leader in its class.This is the perfect sportbike response to the craving of today’s discriminating riders, as the GSX-S750 ABS looks great and outperforms other entries in the class. It is nimble, comfortable, and an exhilarating, fun ride that retains Suzuki’s heritage of quality and reliability.Features may include:Get a grip on a whole new standard. Striking looks. Comfort. Power. Versatility. Our standards deliver easy ergonomics, modern style, and metro muscle in dynamite packages. Whatever type of riding you prefer, our standards can handle it.ENGINEPotent 749cc four-cylinder, fuel injected engine uses 2005 GSX-R750 architecture so the power delivery is an excellent bled of strong low end and a muscular top end.Using the K5 generation GSX-R engine architecture also permits a shorter chassis, which greatly enhances handling. This also makes the GSX-S750 ABS the only motorcycle in its class with an engine with SuperSport lineage.Ventilation holes are added to the bottom side of each cylinder in the GSX-S750 ABS crankcase. The holes reduce pumping loss to help produce power and gain fuel economy.TRANSMISSIONThe race-proven, six-speed, close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine length.The shorter final gear ratio enables the new GSX-S750 ABS to accelerate quicker than the prior model, while the additional engine power maintains the same top speed potential.Large diameter, wet multi-plate clutch is derived from a GSX-R750 design to easily transmit power, while the rack-and-pinion clutch release provides the rider with superb friction-point feel.CHASSISWith styling influenced by the GSX-S1000, but with its own aggressive turn, the GSX-S750 ABS new bodywork looks wild and forceful yet keeps the rider comfortable at all times.The new headlight nacelle provides a visual focal point while the under-cowl connects the chassis styling to the engine and new exhaust system.Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular-style street bike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A reasonable sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests, and seat.\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

Not for the way it looks or because of how many races it’s won. But because of how brutally perfect it is for serious off-road adventures. Fully street legal, thousands of riders use it as a brilliant commuter. But when the road ends and the trails start, an entire generation of riders has proven that this is the machine you want, because it never lets you down.Its ultra-tough 644cc overhead-cam engine has torque and power to spare. And because it’s air-cooled, it’s easy to maintain, and there’s no hoses or radiators to leak out in the middle of nowhere. The engine’s gear-driven counterbalancer reduces vibrations, so you’re more likely to ride farther. Long-travel suspension is trail proven, and easily tames the gnarliest pavement. The XR650L is the dual-sport that rolls up its sleeves and gets the job done.Features may include:Electric from the First Moment On.Rocky uphill section? Stop-and-go traffic? No problem. Starting on the XR650L is easy, thanks to the push-button electric starter with an automatic decompression system. You’ll appreciate it on any terrain.Tough. Like You’d Expect from a Honda.The XR650L is designed to be tougher than the trail with rugged construction, sturdy steel frame, and simple air-cooling. And as a commuter, it’s a beast too.\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

And while the competition promotes their “new” four-valve cylinder heads, Yamaha has been refining the four-valve, twin-spark-plug, pent-roof engine design for nearly 20 years, delivering exceptional power and drivability that leaves the rest of the class in the dust.Smooth Running and CharismaticThe Star Venture engine delivers huge torque with a thrilling V-twin pulse that brings excitement to every ride. And thanks to lightweight forged alloy pistons, carefully-tuned counterbalancers and advanced composite engine mounts, the Star Venture creates a luxuriously smooth ride ideal for days in the saddle without fatigue.New Six-Speed TransmissionDeveloped specifically for the needs of long-distance touring, the six-speed gearbox features ratios chosen to make the most of the huge low-end torque available from the 1854cc engine, for brisk acceleration in lower gears and relaxed highway cruising—at 75 mph in sixth gear, the Star Venture will run at an ultra-smooth 2750 rpm.InfotainmentState-of-the-Art Infotainment SystemMounted high in the cockpit for improved visibility, the 7-inch full-color LCD display puts a huge array of information and control at the rider’s fingertips. Controlled via touchscreen, handlebar controls or voice commands, this infotainment package gives the rider access to vehicle control and data, a range of audio sources and wireless Bluetooth® communications options. The locking fairing storage includes a USB charging and interface port to keep devices topped up, too.Vehicle Control CenterBy integrating vehicle systems into the infotainment console, running data such as trip computer functions and tire pressure can be easily confirmed on-screen, while elements such as the heated seats can be controlled by the rider.Communications SuiteBy linking a Bluetooth®-equipped smartphone, the Star Venture gives the rider complete control of communications with both the passenger and the wider world directly through the infotainment display.Chassis/SuspensionAgile, High-Rigidity FrameThe Star Venture is built around an advanced hybrid chassis designed for agile, confidence-inspiring handling. The main steel frame makes use of casting and forgings to place material exactly where needed for optimal rigidity, while the rear subframe makes use of Yamaha’s advanced aluminum die-casting techniques to reduce weight and centralize mass even further. The balanced chassis gives the Venture a combination of solid straight-line stability with agility on the curviest of roads.Centralized MassThanks to the semi-dry-sump engine, advanced frame design and careful positioning of major components, turn-in and direction changes require less effort, for a more engaging ride with less fatigue. And you can feel the difference every ride, as the Venture requires a massive 22 percent less effort to lift off the sidestand than similar models in the class.\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

Kawasaki Traction Control (KTRC)This advanced traction control system features three different modes to fit rider preference and road conditions. Combining the best from the S-KTRC of the Ninja ZX™-10R with the KTRC settings from the Concours®14, the Ninja 1000 ABS’s KTRC offers a wide range of electronic support.

A fully-adjustable 41mm inverted fork has stepless compression and rebound damping to keep the front wheel planted in turns and over bumps. In the rear, horizontal back-link rear suspension features a remote preload adjuster to facilitate quick changes for when you add a passenger or luggage to your ride.ComfortEven with liter-class power and such a radical appearance, the Ninja 1000 ABS offers a pleasantly comfortable ride. An upright riding position is complemented by higher-mounted handlebars. Also, the rubber-topped pegs are lower, making the Ninja 1000 ABS a comfortable sportbike you can spend the day aboard enjoyably.WindscreenThe windscreen of the 2015 Ninja 1000 ABS has three easily adjustable positions to choose from so you can fine tune your wind-protection easily - no tools required.\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

From our humble beginnings in 1983 as a small Honda dealership on the corner of Arizona Avenue and Elliot Road. At a time when the industry was sagging following the collapse of the 3 wheel ATC market, there was much unknown about how a little dealer would survive when loosing one of your most popular products relying only on sales & service of lawn gear, garden equipment, generators and even bicycles.\\n\\nEventually it was decided that we were going to drop all non-powersports products and focus on the fun; the core of our business. Turns out that was a bold decision that eventually turned out to be a great one. The powersports industry came back with new and exciting vehicles and we never looked back.\\n\\nTown and Country Motorsports old store, RideNow Chandler / Euro\\nA new building was opened and named Town & Country Motorsports for the next 21 years we\\'ve continued to serve our customers with the most popular brands for sales, parts and service. Renamed RideNow Chandler / Euro in early 2005, the old \"Town & Country\" building continues to operate as the RideNow Chandler / Euro Insurance office, communications and warehouse distribution area.\\n\\nIn early 2015, with the help of our customers support, we started construction on what will be the largest multi-line dealership in the Arizona but none of this would be possible if wasn\\'t for the greatest customers on the planet. From our family to your family thank you!\\n\\nWe have out grown our last house and have now moved into a 130,000 sq ft mega showroom just off Gilbert Rd. and San Tan Loop 202 in Chandler, AZ.

Its V-twin, the most powerful one we ever muscled into a street bike, beats the battle drums at 177 hp, while its purebred chassis is set to stay ahead when the straight is devoured. When corners become prey. Even on a bad day, thanks to state-of-the-art rider assistance systems. No, scratch that. Grin amplifiers.Features may include:ENGINE & EXHAUSTFast just became faster. This is our punk record - pure, raw and straight to the point: speed. Its V-twin, the most powerful one we ever muscled into a street bike beating the battle drums at 177 hp.CHASSISWith its ultra-lightweight yet extremely stable trellis frame, a beautifully manufactured single-sided swingarm and state-of-the-art WP suspension components, the KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE R exceeds all requirements for stability and control. Tubeless wheels, 17-inch front and rear, with the latest Metzeler M7RR tires offer tremendous traction on asphalt and let you exploit the bike’s capabilities to the fullest. Feedback? Check. Safety? Check. Fun? Double check.ERGONOMICS & COMFORTThe powerful and cultivated engine enables either super-sporty propulsion or, when required, relaxed and comfortable riding - with every conceivable level in between. The chassis combines lightness with outstanding geometry and fantastic suspension, which, together with every feasible electronic riding aid, allow undreamed riding pleasure in all conditions and whatever speed you desire, from very relaxed to very, very fast.BODYWORK & GRAPHICSThe bodywork with sharp rear end, extended tank spoilers and air intakes, the ultra lightweight chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame and the ready to race WP suspension components convert brute power into a usable tool. The elimination of plastic parts shouts \\'NAKED\\' and create a BEAST which is always READY TO RACE.SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICSConquer the streets and the racetrack with unique look and features that contribute to exploit the full potential of the BEAST. Unrivaled braking from world market leader Brembo and assistance systems (MTC and lean-angle sensitive ABS), developed in close collaboration with Bosch, round off the package and help the 1290 SUPER DUKE R into a clear lead straight from the start in terms of ride dynamics and safety.ACCESSORIES & LUGGAGEKTM know its customers like to modify and to travel, which is why the PowerParts range boasts a huge variety of accessories and luggage options across its Street range of sportmotorcycles - past and present. All PowerParts are developed alongside their chosen machine, meaning that KTM riders only get parts that perfectly complement their ride and provide that important ‘factory fit’ straight from the dealer.\\nRideNow Chandler\\naddress:    2677 E.

This redesigned road-adventure-loving motorcycle offers sporty styling, an upright seating position, ABS technology, a fuel-efficient engine and ample storage space via new KQR 28-liter hard saddlebags (standard with Versys 650 LT model). The Versys 650 has exceptional longrange asphalt-touring potential for great fun on winding roads. When you’re ready, it’s ready.Redesigning FunThe all-new sporty design of the Versys 650 balances style, wind protection, aerodynamics and heat management to provide an exciting, comfortable ride. The upright seating position is relaxed, while the wide handlebar makes initiating turns easier. The horizontal dual headlamps are also new for this year to enhance style and improve visibility.EngineThe 651cc, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected, parallel-twin engine pumps out strong low- to mid-range torque that is usable, fun, and responsive on most any road. Tuned for versatile performace, the compact parallel-twin is a thrill to ride across town or across state lines. And revised Digital Fuel Injection (DFI®) helps to improve fuel economy for even longer adventures.Wheels & TiresThe Versys 650 ABS / LT can respectably lean into the corners in true sportbike fashion, or tour for hours on your favorite back roads thanks to sporty 17-inch wheels cradled in new front and rear tires that provide greater traction under a variety of conditions—including wet pavement.Full InstrumentationThe instrument cluster of the new Versys 650 models is equipped with a digital analog tachometer, fuel gauge, odometer, speedometer and ‘ECO’ icon to let riders know when they’re getting the best fuel economy.Enhanced AdjustabilityBoth Versys 650 models have a larger windscreen than the previous model year for added wind protection. Plus the all-new windscreen is fully adjustable—no tools required. For further comfort during long highway cruises, the footpegs on the Versys 650 have been moved lower and further forward.SuspensionBoth Versys 650 models are equipped with long-travel front suspension for a glued-to-the-road feel on winding, uneven roads.

This is the bike so many have been waiting for. The one serious riders have dreamed about. A true street-legal dirtbike that offers the reliability, refinement and quality of a Honda, along with the light weight, handling, and power of our best off-road machines. Introducing the new 2019 CRF450L. Sure, you’ve seen dual-sport bikes before, but this is something much, much more: a true trail-to-trail machine. Developed in tandem with our all-new 2019 CRF450X, it features a powerful 449cc Unicam engine, twin-spar aluminum CRF chassis, six-speed transmission, and premium suspension. Electric start? Naturally. All-LED lighting package? Of course. Until now, you’ve always had to choose between performance and reliability. No longer—with the CRF450L, you get the best of both worlds. And “best” is a word you’re going to hear a lot when you’re talking about this bike.Features may include:FULLY STREET LEGALThe CRF450L is equipped with a catalytic converter and is fully street legal in all 50 states. That means you can ride it wherever it’s legal to operate a motor vehicle—in state and national parks, on the road, on public lands. Plus, you don’t need to haul your bike to the trailhead in a truck or on a trailer. Best of all, it makes finding gas a breeze.ELECTRIC STARTAn electric start system ensures trouble-free starting in all conditions. The electric starter also drives the clutch side of the crankshaft to provide superior lubrication to starter gears while producing a narrow engine with a short, strong crank.449cc UNICAM ENGINEHonda’s Unicam cylinder heads combine the best of single- and double-overhead-cam designs. The configuration contributes to a compact engine that saves weight over a comparable dual-overhead-camshaft motor and also permits a narrow included valve angle. This flattens the combustion chamber to facilitate ignition flame propagation, allowing a high compression ratio. Since less space is taken up in the cylinder head, the camshaft sits lower in the head for a more compact engine and a lower center of gravity.SIX-SPEED TRANSMISSIONLike our CRF450X, the CRF450L rocks a six-speed gearbox. That gives you a low gear perfect for tight, slow situations, and a top gear that’s tall enough for highway riding to the next gas stop or trailhead.\\nRideNow Chandler\\naddress:    2677 E.

It’s almost like having a big-bore thumper without the uncomfortable vibration.Adventure-Ready MotorCompact engine design uses a dry-sump oil supply inside the crankcase, boosting ground clearance, while a side-mounted radiator makes the Super Ténéré surprising narrow and protects the radiator from rocks and debris.Advanced Fuel InjectionDowndraft twin bore fuel injection system with 12-hole injectors is tuned for on- or off-road adventures, and is equally at home commuting as it is on long stretches of open highway.Chassis/SuspensionRobust Steel ChassisThe steel frame is designed to reduce rider fatigue during long rides. Using a steel main frame offers the best balance of strength and flexibility so it can help absorb jolts from uneven road surfaces.Assured BrakingThe ABS and Unified Brake System (UBS) work together to help prevent wheel lock during braking. This system allows the rider to operate front and rear brakes together by simply pulling the front brake lever, especially helpful when riding while standing on the pegs.

I bought it to cruise Crown King and four Peaks with my buddies and ride to work. I just bought a Harley Fat Boy and for garage space reasons I need to sell this one. The battery is almost brand new, and I have the tether on for charging when not used. I also added the three bags which are Kawasaki factory bags, which I can howl quite a bit of stuff for camping etc.… Also bark buster hand grip covers which are much stouter for riding in the woods with brush and branches.

The bike has a power panel with a cigarette lighter and USB charger for your phone charger. The engine has had the Eagle Mike Doohickey tensioner installed along with Progressive front fork springs and a heavier rear spring. The KLR has the larger fairing than the XR650L and the DR650 so road riding is MUCH nicer without the wind buffeting. I'm ready to move on to a BMW 1200GSA so I have to make room in the garage. If you ever wanted to get into dual sport riding, then here is your chance to step into a machine that is set up and ready to ride.   $3600    \",\n",

This is an in-store only special. Shipping is not included in this price.  💥 \\n\\nThe City M8 Sport scooter/moped provides 100% electric power with zero emissions, and zero fuel at a great price. Whether you’re a novice or experienced motorcycle rider, you can easily use these fun little bikes to commute to your office, run errands around town, or visit the supermarket. All this comes at a low cost, with stylish looks, and saves the planet one throttle pull at a time. \\nElectric powered scooters and motorcycles are getting a lot more popular these days because people are tired of the high cost of getting around town, fighting traffic hassles, and they want to help to save the environment. M8-Tech believes in this thinking, and they figured, why not save money, help save the planet, and look good doing it. Join the e-bike movement and come along for the ride!\\nThe City M8 offers a reliable alternative to premium-class Mopeds. Our scooters are fun, comfortable, and easy to ride. The City M8 was engineered and built by enthusiasts just like you. Our team has ridden motorcycles for years and have found that Electric bikes are just as fun and enjoyable as the gas-powered alternative. The thing is, times are changing, electric power is the future. The City M8 is powered by a class-leading brushless motor, allowing it to rip at a maximum speed of 35 mph with plenty of torque and a climbing angle of 25 degrees (when switched to the closed-course mode). Deep in the body of the City M8 lies a 72v lithium battery, when fully charged is good for miles of trips around town. In terms of comfort, the M8 doesn’t disappoint with its fully adjustable 140mm rear shock, and 140mm front fork. For safety, the M8 is fitted with disc brakes, front and rear, and wide 12-inch super grip tires, for a smooth ride.\\n(Special pricing is limited to stock on hand. You must mention this ad to get this price.)\\n💥 The City M8 sport scooters have many benefits over other motorized vehicles.💥  These features include:\\n✔️ Environmentally friendly. The City M8 helps you save on the consumption of gas/fuel. They require zero fuel, which means you can travel many miles without worrying about fuel expenses. The City M8 has zero exhaust spewing into the environment, which makes it an ideal alternative for people who want to ride without causing harm to the environment.\\n✔️ Less Maintenance. The City M8 has fewer moving parts, which means less maintenance and repair costs, as compared to a gas bike, motorbike or even a motorcycle. This is because the entire motor is in the rear wheel: no chain, no shifting, no pedals. \\n✔️ Quiet. The City M8 is super quiet, with almost no noise pollution as compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. Reminder: The City M8 is stealthy, so don’t spook your neighbor's dog. He may not like it.\\n✔️ Lower Cost of Ownership. If operated as an e-scooter, there is no registration, no license, no insurance, no plate, and no title. We can’t tell you how much fun you’ll have with short rides around the city, beating traffic as you zip past all the stopped cars. Plus, think how cool you'll look riding the City M8. (In Arizona, you must operate a scooter under 20mph and only adjacent the highway or on designated paths. Even when registered as a moped, you only need a license, insurance, registration, and proof of ownership. Not a legal opinion – see an attorney for legal advice.) \\nHighlights\\n💥 Zero Emissions - Zero Gasoline\\n💥 Low Maintenance\\n💥 Easy to Ride\\n💥 Brushless 2000-watt motor (2,000w peak output, 750w nominal in street mode)\\n💥 Maximum speed of 19mph (street mode) / 45mph (track mode)\\n💥 72V-20AH lithium-ion battery: provides 30-60 mile riding distance, depending on conditions\\n💥 Charge time: 6 to 8hours\\n💥 Hydraulic disc brakes, front and rear\\n💥 Tubeless 120/70 12-inch tires\\n💥 210 lbs., measuring 69” (L) x 31”(W) x 69”(H)\\n💥 Strong carbon steel frame\\n💥 Easy to read LED display, all-LED headlights, and indicator lights\\n💥 Storage (that’s not a gas tank)\\n💥 Spring/oil front fork 140mm and Rear spring/air/oil with compression/rebound setting, 140mm\\n💥 One-size fits most riders\\n💥 Color option: RED / BLUE (more colors coming soon)\\n\\nThe City M8 is in stock, charged up, test-driven, and ready to ride home today.

Country Club Drive, in Mesa\\n☎️Call: 480-275-5818\\n🛍️Shop: www.archersbikes.com\\n👍Open 10-6 Tue-Sat and 11-3 Sun, closed Mon\\n\\nWe have a HUGE selection of new and used gas bikes, electric bikes and pedal bikes for sale at our shop in Mesa. Mountain, commuter, road, comfort, trike, fixie, tandem and more. Brands include Haro, KHS, Specialized, Pivot, Trek, Cannondale, Giant, Roadmaster, Schwinn, Raleigh, and other major brands. New bikes arrive daily, so come on down to find the right bike for you.\\n\\nOur shop is licensed and insured. We also take trade-ins and buy used bicycles. We accept cash and all major credit cards. No checks, please. If interested, call our shop for more details or just stop by and have a look! We also have a very large selection of used bicycle wheels and parts. We stock gas bike kits and parts.\\n\\nBuying A Used Bicycle\\n\\nBuying a used bicycle can be risky. You might get someone else's problems. At Archer's Bikes, we go through every used bike, especially the brakes and drive train, to ensure the bike works properly. There may be a little rust, bump or ding - it's still a used bike - but you save a lot. Either way, you can get back on the road quickly, and at a reasonable cost, because we always give our customers a fair deal. We even have a large selection of used bike parts, at very attractive prices. If something goes wrong, bring the bike back to the shop for us to fix it. Ultimately though, you are responsible for the operation of the bicycle, so make sure to check everything before you ride. Wear a helmet. \\n\\nThe good news: Our used bikes come with a limited 30-day warranty. If the bike fails to meet your expectations, bring it back in 30-days and we will fix it (excluding parts). If you get a bike home and find it's not right for you, bring it back within 10-days (less 10% restocking) for store credit on another bike of your choice (of equal or greater value). (Limitations may apply, read your sales invoice for more details.)\\n\\n☺\\n    \",\n",

From its blacked-out looks and low-slung seat, to its compact frame, the Rebel® 300 rocks as is, or makes the perfect platform for customization. But don’t let that steal the thunder from its performance, because it’s also equipped with a sporty engine, a great lean angle and of course, Honda reliability. All together, the Rebel® 300 delivers the performance and style riders of all skill levels can enjoy.Features may include:SPORTY ENGINEHondas are famous for their engines, and we’ve given the Rebel® 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.BLACKED-OUT STYLEThe new Rebel® is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.LOW SEAT HEIGHTWhen it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the new Rebel® has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.SUPERIOR HANDLINGA lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the new Rebel® is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

You can sit up straighter, without supporting your weight on your arms. It’s a great choice when you’re riding around town or commuting, and you can always tuck in tighter when you want to. And it’s more comfortable for passengers.Confidence Is Built-InAs a lighter bike in the 500 class, the CB500F is easier to handle, whether it’s putting it up on the side stand or paddling it backwards into a parking space. And its low seat height makes it easier to plant both feet securely on the ground at stoplights.Parallel Twin-Cylinder EngineBuilt with a high performance liquid-cooled 471cc DOHC parallel twin engine that offers accessible power and a comfortable ride across all RPM ranges.Wanna Ride?

Developed using the attributes of the championship winning 2005 - 2008 generation GSX-R1000, this sportbike carries the spirit of the Suzuki performance to the street, with shared technology and components packaged into a chassis designed specifically for all-day riding comfort.It’s more than just an attitude, a spirit, or a lineage though; it’s about performance-packed hard parts evolving from one generation to the next. The GSX-S1000Z is powered by a 999cc inline four-cylinder powerplant that’s based on the legendary long-stroke GSX-R1000 engine, which makes for ideal street-riding power and torque curve. Focused on making big power through the low and mid-range, this engine uses a valve-train that’s optimized to deliver street-dominating power.Equipped with a more powerful engine for 2018, Suzuki’s Advanced Traction Control System**, a balanced KYB suspension, plus ABS-equipped Brembo and NISSIN brakes, the GSX-S1000Z is a street bike packed with some serious performance. Top that performance off with aggressive streetfighter styling that’s as dark as midnight and you have a motorcycle that puts sinister fun at your fingertips.Features may include:Get a grip on a whole new standard. Striking looks. Comfort. Power. Versatility. Our standards deliver easy ergonomics, modern style, and metro muscle in dynamite packages. Whatever type of riding you prefer, our standards can handle it.Fuel-injected, GSX-R based engine has increased horsepower and torqueABS-equipped* Brembo front brakes deliver improved stopping performanceTwin-spar aluminum frame and adjustable KYB suspension delivers controlled handlingENGINEThe strong, four-stroke, liquid-cooled, DOHC, 999cc inline-four engine is designed to provide smooth throttle response and controlled accelerationNew ventilation holes between the cylinders reduces pumping loss within the crankcase so the engine can deliver more power and torqueLong-stroke GSX-R engine design has broad low-to-mid range power and torque that is ideal for street riding.TRANSMISSIONThe race-proven six-speed close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine lengthThe new SCAS clutch increases plate pressure under acceleration yet acts as a slipper clutch to smooth the engine response during engine braking and corner entryThis large diameter, wet multi-plate clutch uses a precise cable activated release providing the rider with superb friction-point feelCHASSISLightweight and compact chassis is engineered to be agile and fun-to-ride for a wide range of riders. This ability starts with the low-mass rigid aluminum main frame coupled with the strong aluminum-alloy swingarmThe new 43mm inverted KYB forks have adjustable compression and rebound damping, and spring pre-load with a generous 120mm (4.7 in) of front wheel travelLink-type rear suspension, with arched aluminum swingarm and a single shock absorber that features spring preload that is 7-way adjustable with rebound damping force adjustmentELECTRICALThe GSX-S1000 premiered Suzuki’s Easy-start System that requires just a simple touch of the starter button to fire up the engine (without pulling the clutch lever if the transmission is in neutral)Distinctively shaped headlight nacelle contains a bright 60/55W H4 halogen bulb. The tail section houses an integrated LED taillight with clear lens\\nRideNow Goodyear\\naddress:    13690 W.

Feet forward. Fists in the wind. Hard Candy Custom™ fat metal flake paint on a 2.1 gallon peanut tank, classic skinny whitewalls, raked front end. But, unlike the 70’s garage choppers that came before it, it has confidence inspiring front and rear brakes. And plenty more tech to make the ride better. The Seventy-Two® motorcycle. Modern day refinement. True, old school outlaw soul.Features May Include:Authentic StylingWhen the first Sportster motorcycle roared onto the scene in 1957 the world had never seen anything like it. Rawboned, powerful and looking for action. The styling cues that lit up the street in those early years would soon become a part of everything from race bikes to outlaw choppers as they spread throughout the motorcycling world. Take a look at the offering for 2016 and one thing becomes instantly clear. The best way to get the style that made the Sportster motorcycle famous is to get a Sportster motorcycle of your own. The narrow frame is more agile than ever. The rumbling V-Twin and muscular front end feel more powerful than ever. The flawless steel and jewel-like fuel tank reveal their authentic American motorcycle roots in every inch of detail.Iconic EngineThe Evolution engine riding in the nimble Sportster frame is a prime example of the power, durability and proven reliability The Motor Company was built on. Born from the legendary Shovelhead and Ironhead engines, it’s been the power at the center of a Sportster motorcycle since 1984. Its overhead valve design and four-cam gear train have their roots in the company’s race program, and you know it when you feel the surge of brute torque that accompanies every twist of the throttle. The air-cooled V-Twin design with a compact one-piece crankcase/transmission fits the narrow Sportster profile like a fist in a fingerless glove. We began with a strong, trouble-free design. Then gave it constant refinement to bring us to the modern powerplant of today. A testament to the unwavering hunger for advancement in motor technology that has always driven Harley-Davidson.TechnologyWhat the eye sees and the rider feels on a Sportster motorcycle goes deep beneath the surface. Which is where you’ll find some our latest technology hard at work. The immaculate styling is due in part to an integrated electrical system that reduces wiring harnesses, switches, relays and fuses. The new seats throughout the Sportster line are built out of 21 century materials to feel plush and look minimalist at the same time. The new suspension systems are a marvel, with cartridge damping up front and an adjustable cartridge emulsion system in back. The one thing you won’t find on a Sportster motorcycle is any gizmos. Technology is there for one reason and one reason only. To make the motorcycle even more honest, enduring and satisfying for the rider.ComfortYou might look at the raw-boned style of a Sportster motorcycle and not immediately think of comfort. That would be a mistake. Sink into the seat of any 2016 Sportster model and you discover a premium ride hidden under all the lean and mean styling. The engine is rubber-mounted to the frame, so you feel all the power of an Evolution V-Twin but none of the vibrations. The handlebar hits your fists and the pegs hit your boots just the way they should. Even better, we’ve made improving comfort for the Sportster rider our marching orders for 2016.\\nRideNow Chandler\\naddress:    2677 E.

From our humble beginnings in 1983 as a small Honda dealership on the corner of Arizona Avenue and Elliot Road. At a time when the industry was sagging following the collapse of the 3 wheel ATC market, there was much unknown about how a little dealer would survive when loosing one of your most popular products relying only on sales & service of lawn gear, garden equipment, generators and even bicycles.\\n\\nEventually it was decided that we were going to drop all non-powersports products and focus on the fun; the core of our business. Turns out that was a bold decision that eventually turned out to be a great one. The powersports industry came back with new and exciting vehicles and we never looked back.\\n\\nTown and Country Motorsports old store, RideNow Chandler / Euro\\nA new building was opened and named Town & Country Motorsports for the next 21 years we\\'ve continued to serve our customers with the most popular brands for sales, parts and service.

It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look.Features may include:Blacked-Out LookIt’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.Street Inspired PaintWe created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.Low Seat & Slammed SuspensionThe combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you\\'re dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.Tuck and Roll SeatA solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.Machined 9-Spoke WheelsNine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® Engine Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.Drag-Style HandlebarBorn at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.\\nRideNow Chandler\\naddress:    2677 E.

Locked-up tires are now history even when there’s wet pavement. We’ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we’ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.Jukebox with USB Port for iPod/iPhoneThe Jukebox opens easily and includes a USB connection which accepts your iPhone, iTouch, non-iPod imitators, and SD card and other USB compatible devices. Pop it open, plug in and your device becomes a part of your motorcycle. Ready to be operated by voice command or hand controls.Project RUSHMORE - ComfortWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders and passengers putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Airflow, heat management, passenger space, back rests, seat textures, legroom and hand controls all went under the hard microscope of the road and got tested and re-tested by real riders and worked and re-worked by us until we were satisfied we had built the most comfortable machines on the road. We all want to go farther, and when you and your passenger are more comfortable in the saddle, you can.Project RUSHMORE - StylingProject RUSHMORE is the journey we set out on to take our touring motorcycles to places never imagined before - to turn all the possibilities for what a motorcycle can be now into true Milwaukee steel. We did it our way, as we’ve always done. As riders. Riding with other riders. Thousand of hours, countless road tests, millions of miles. Looking for the technology and innovations that truly make the ride better. We went over the bike fender tip to fender tip. Making it work better. Making it look sleeker. Modern. Clean. Tight. Let your eye take the journey over the machine. This is classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek, modern look at the exact same time. At Harley-Davidson, form has always followed function. And both have always reported to emotion. Now we’re just doing it on a completely different level.\\nRideNow Powersports Peoria\\naddress:    8546 W.

Based largely on the Ninja® ZX™-14R and equipped with an adjustable windshield with a new vent, as well as a redesigned seat, the Concours14 brings the thrill of a supersport to the promise of the open road. And of course rider support functions such as the recalibrated K-ACT ABS, KTRC traction control, fuel economy assistance mode, and the KIPASS ignition security system make this bike one of the most sophisticated supersport-tourers on the market.Features may include:EngineBased on the extremely powerful Ninja ZX-14R, the 1352cc in-line four-cylinder engine produces smooth power delivery throughout the extremely wide rev range. The variable valve timing improves the flexibility and efficiency of the engine by altering the intake camshaft profile to boost low-end and mid-range power. The compact and narrow engine design minimizes weight for massive performance making the Concours14 an impressive supersport-tourer.FrameAlso based on the ZX-14R, the monocoque frame of the Concours14 is light and rigid. Hollow aluminum box sections arch over the engine from the steering head to the swingarm pivot, and the engine acts as a stressed frame member to increase the frame’s torsional rigidity.Kawasaki Traction Control(KTRC)Control is everything, especially in wet weather, which is why the KTRC (or Kawasaki Traction Control) system is so valuable. The KTRC system reduces engine output when wheel-spin is detected, helping the rear tire to regain grip in a way that feels natural and smooth. Advanced, three-way control (airflow, ignition timing, fuel delivery) gives KTRC smooth operation and the ability to operate on long stretches of rough roads.Slipper ClutchSudden downshifts can be smoothed out as all Concours14 models are equipped with a slipper clutch for smooth, confident shifting. During sudden deceleration, the racinginspired slipper function allows some clutch slippage to help prevent engine lock-up, stalling and rear-wheel hop.Suspension & BrakesHighly rigid 43mm inverted forks add to the Concours14’s superb handling and feel. And if the situation calls for a sudden stop, the revised and recalibrated Kawasaki Coactive-braking Technology (K-ACT) ABS system is smaller and more precise, with revised settings for improved performance. Two selectable modes provide superb sport control and inspire rider confidence.Redesigned SeatThe redesigned seat is narrower and flatter for improved rider and passenger comfort. An available accessory touring seat features extra padding and is made from an industry-first heat-resistant material.\\nRideNow Powersports Peoria\\naddress:    8546 W.

A few very light scuffs on lower exhaust and brake lever knob. \\n\\nAsking $5500\\n\\ntags: harley sportster yamaha sport bike naked bike street fighter roadster street rod street fighter 500 750 yamaha bolt    \",\n",

The 2011 and 2012 RM-Z450 both took home Cycle World's Best Motocrosser in its annual Ten Best Bikes awards! The 2013 looks to continue this tradition of being the best. Following the 2011 RM-Z450's sweep in the award two years prior, Cycle World praised the 2012 model's powerful engine, smooth throttle response and excellent handling capabilities that made it the clear winner in this year's awards. For 2013, the RM-Z450 is redesigned to give you an even greater edge. With a thoroughly refined engine, it develops exceptional power from idle to redline and incredibly crisp throttle response. It also features the innovative new Separate Function front Fork (SFF) from Showa. The new front suspension works with an updated twin-spar aluminum frame engineered for an optimum balance between rigidity and high-speed traction, providing you with incredibly precise handling and smooth performance on the toughest tracks. The new RM-Z450 - it puts championship-winner performance in your control to reach the top of the podium!Champions Choose Suzuki...and Suzuki supports future champions! In addition to all the high-tech features and race-winning performance of the 2013 RM-Z models, Suzuki offers the best amateur racing program around!Get an edge on the competition by finishing out the 2012 contingency year on a Champion Approved 2013 RM-Z450. American Suzuki will be offering millions in contingency for 2013 at events nationwide!Features May IncludeIn 2011 Suzuki introduced the coupler system to the RM-Z450. The 2013 RM-Z450 uses this innovative design, which consists of three couplers that allow you to quickly adjust the fuel setting to suit riding conditions. One coupler contains the stock settings, a second is for a richer fuel setting than the stock setting and the third is for a leaner setting.All-new Showa Separate Function front Fork (SFF) separates spring and damping functions. The right leg holds the spring, while the left leg incorporates the cartridge assembly to manage damping. The SFF design reduces friction, increased absorption performance and is lighter weight resulting in remarkably smooth performance over a variety of track conditions.EngineRedesigned muffler internal parts, bottom-to-mid range power and torque are increased, resulting in improved performance without losing top end. The new muffler body now uses conventional bolts in end cap instead of rivets to simplify the replacement of the glass wool packing in the muffler.Compact and lightweight 4-stroke, 449cc, fuel-injected, DOHC engine provides extraordinary torque for awesome acceleration from idle to redline, with incredible high-rpm power.TransmissionRedesigned 5-speed transmission with reshaped shift cam, stopper spring and drive shaft results in more solid shift feel, enabling more precise gear shift operation.ChassisTo maintain the RM-Z's renowned handling performance, each bike's rear suspension features a Showa Piggyback shock with setting changes and adjustments to best match with the increased engine performance and front forks changes. The design allows enhanced suspension performance for a wider variety of riders. Let Us Get You Approved!
